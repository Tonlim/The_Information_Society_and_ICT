The music \nvolume was WAY off for this video!","I utterly agree with you.","+Dennis Liu We can hope, but I feel that distastes are still imminent, not \ndue to conversion, but due to other unforeseeable things.","+DreadKyller That sounds good \u003dD, hopefully no more that type of disasters \nin the future.","+Dennis Liu For fields like that metric is always used now, for those \nspecific reasons. Even here in the US we use the metric system every time a \nmeasurement has to be precise or coordinated with anyone else, pretty much \nany field of science uses the metric system no matter where you live.","+Arrvi I agree measurement system needs to be standarized, there are at \nleast one engineering disasters and one airplane incident merely caused by \nthe different measuring system that different engineers used.. e.g.: \nAirplane run out of fuel in mid air because they done their fuel \ncalculation with pounds instead of kilograms while the calculating tools \nare expecting kilograms as unit..\ne.g.2: Mars Climate Orbiter suffered unplanned rapid disintegration while \nperforming aerobrake over Mar\u0027s atmosphere. Because one software NASA used \nto supply parameters to calculate orbit maneuvers supplied non-metric units \nwhile the orbit calculation expected metric units, the orbiter flew too \nclose into Mar\u0027s atmosphere and is destroyed. Successfully converting it \ninto a shooting star at the cost of 300 million USD.\n\n\nHowever, I am not sure whether we should discard other metric system once \nand for all, because I am not sure what the side effect will be. Maybe \nthose system are better than metric system at some aspect. I am just not \nsure, so I have no comment on that (not agree nor disagree).","+DreadKyller I see your point. But for me, metric system is more intuitive \nas it is being used as only one in most of the world, including my country. \nImperial is more intuitive for people who were taught to use it. In this \ncase I\u0027d still go for metric, because it\u0027s simpler and *can* be intuitive. \nOther thing is mixing them. In this video some measures were given in \ninches only and some in metric units - that\u0027s even more confusing for both \ngroups.\n\nThere\u0027s only one place where I can understand and accept non-metric systems \n- long distance navigation. I do some sailing from time to time, so I had \nto use nautical miles and knots. These are ok, because they are based on \ngeographical coordinates and are easier to use with simple tools and a map \nwhich might be crucial in case of electronic navigation failure. I think it \nis also applies to flights.\n\nI also know that discussion on this is pointless, so I\u0027m not going to argue \nfurther.","+Arrvi eh, they did mention a lot of metric measurements, such as 4 nm, \nnanometers are metric, since they\u0027re based off of the meter.\n\n\nMetric is based off of universal constants such as planck\u0027s length, \nimperial is based off of common measurements from objects used in common \nliving. Metric is based off of science, imperial is based off of human \ninteraction with the world. While imperial isn\u0027t very good to do exact \nmeasurements with, it\u0027s easier to compare imperial measurements to certain \ntypes of objects are they are more easily divisible because the measurement \nis based off sizes of objects that are related. Personally i feel both have \ntheir place. I do agree that the metric system is probably better, but \nsometimes it\u0027s easier to use the imperial system when talking about \nspecific sizes that may be 1.7683 of some size in metric. I guess it would \nbe nice to say \"x cm (or y inches)\", I guess it depends on who\u0027s doing the \ntalk though.","+MoinBayern \nMe too since the amount of threats to cloud services has increased and the \nfact that the FBI, NSA, and CIA want backdoor access to those cloud \nservices discourages me to use them.","+Marcos Cruz Yeah. tbh though I\u0027m not that much of a fan of cloud services. \nI much rather like to know exactly where my data is stored (and who has \naccess to it) and not on multiple dubious servers somewhere around the \nworld.","+MoinBayern \nHopefully our infrastructure will be able to keep up with the increasing \ndemand of the public\u0027s streaming needs and ISPs behave somewhat civilized \nand not decrease data caps and throttle those who use the services they \nalready pay for because of their cooperate greed.","+MoinBayern Also with cloud storage becoming more popular you might not \nneed much more than a quick and small SSD. like one of the new chromebooks. \nThat has just 16GB flash storage, but integrated Google Drive as the main \nstorage.","True","+Marcos Cruz of course it is. my point was that until SSDs will reach as \nhigh storage capacities as that for a reasonable price it will take time. \nuntil then HDDs will still be used, mostly of course for servers because at \nleast nowadays the average user does not need much more than a maximum of a \nfew TBs and will then obviously rather go for SSDs.","+MoinBayern \nIt\u0027s not just about capacity, but about read/write speeds too.

The processor then uses the OS to interperate the data into \na useable form. THis is heavily oversimplified of course.","how software works in the hard drive is easy each byte is equal to a letter \nso code like print \"hello\"(python) is a few bytes that output a visual \nwhich is hello and with complex code graphics can be made basically what \nyou see right now are all 1s \u0026 0s","something something something I forgot","+Sam Barkley It\u0027s a complex topic (programming) and software and data are \nseparate things.\nA software is an executable file (.exe), which consists of a list of \ncommands for the processor, stored in a file (i.e .exe).\nA data file is just data, like text, picture, etc. Both reside on the HDD. \nBoth (and everything) is stored in binary (0s,1s).\n\nProgramming is complex but basically everything is hierarchical (starting \nfrom the simple and building on top of them, level by level).\nThere are low-level and high-level programming languages, they mark the two \nextremes of this hierarchy.\nUltimately everything is binary, but even programmers couldn\u0027t work with 0s \nand 1s. \nLow-level lngs do that, they access the built-in registers of every CPU and \ncommand them directly.\nWith it one can only create simple, basic commands, nothing complex.\nHigh-level lngs include several more steps in the process, each step built \non the previous.\n\nI could explain it like this: Say you want your program to draw a triangle.\nIt is ultimately pixels at certain coordinates...\nYou can write \"functions\", pieces of codes with names, that you can always \nreuse. Like the SUM(A1,C1) function in Excel... someone programmed what SUM \nwill do and you just need to write SUM not the actual code later.\nBut in programming the programmer uses the functions, the end user sees the \ntriangle :)\n\nSo you write a function say DrawTriangle(a,b,c) and define what it does. \n(once written, you can use this for your program like \nDrawTriangle(coordinate1,c2,c3))\nBut inside defining this triangle function, what do you do? You need to \ndraw 3 lines between the coordinates.\nSo this function only has 3 commands: You \"call\" (use, refer to) a line \ndrawing function:\nDrawLine(a,b)\nDrawLine(b,c)\nDrawLine(a,c)\n\nBut Inside the line function, what do you do? \nYou need to draw many pixels between two coordinates (\u003da line). So here you \nwill have more than 3 commands- you will do complex calculations to find \nout which pixels on your monitor fall in line with the imaginary line \nbetween x and y:\n\u003ccaluclating \"Coordinate\"\u003e\nDrawPixel(Coordinate)\nand repeating (with calculations and a \"loop\" (cycle) for as many pixels is \nneeded.\n\nBut the DrawPixel function has to be written as well, which is way more \ncomplicated, from taking control of the screen, videocard, its memory, \ninitialize a video mode (fullscreen at a given resolution, where Windows \ncan\u0027t draw over), use the video card\u0027s memory at a certain address from \nwhich a monitor will refresh the content (draw the content on screen) etc \netc. which are all low level, binary, complex.\n\nThis is the hierarchy. It gets more and more technical.\nAt one end is the tiniest step of a command to the CPU or videocard (and \nmany of them), at the very end is the one \"DrawTriangle\" function. I mean \nyou will use more \"higher level\" functions that are built on previous \npre-written ones.\n\nSome pr. lngs have pixel drawing capabilites, some use Windows windows, \nsome use DirectX and have built-in \"DrawTriangle\"-like functions, etc.\nSo with different programming languages you realize the same idea different \nways (e.g. to just draw a triangle). Each lng codes the result to CPU \ncommands differently, but each does, and ultimately everything is binary.\nImagine if instead of writing DrawTriangle, you would have to write 100x as \nmany low level CPU commands. It\u0027s impossible.\n\nI hope this shed a bit of light on what binary, commands, files, etc are.","+Sam Barkley Magic","It\u0027s all 1\u0027s and 0\u0027s that correspond to off/on electrical signals.

Just imagine if \nyou wrote the letter A as 10011001 and B as 10011010 and so on.

He never claimed \nto be a prophet or the like in fact, he solidified the position of the \nruler(wang) as the son of god( or the son of heaven(tian zi) to be precise).","+???\n*May your soul find peace someday.*\n\nMay you find reason and leave mysticism behind.\n\n\n\n*You are a lost soul.*\n\nWhere\u0027s the evidence such thing exist?","You are a lost soul. And no, I\u0027m neither Christian/Muslim/Jewish. It is \nclear as day that you do not seek enlightenment but to oppress those that \nhave different belief or dogma from you. May your soul find peace someday.","+Tom Sistermans\nYou are half right. Christianity claims to be ethical and moral but their \nfairytale book is completely the opposite of that. They just twist the \nwords to fit a good moral behaviour and excuse the rest saying \"look at the \ncontext, the moral lesson\" but what\u0027s moral in saying one should be happy \nby smashing their kids agains rocks? Or even a petty imaginary god thirsty \nfor blood killing babies in women\u0027s wombs? How\u0027s that a moral lesson?\n\nI get a long well with many religious peope that keep their myth in their \nhomes and churches/temples.\n\nMy issue is when they try to impose their view on the society and judge \npeople like they were a good example. Example of how to torture people that \nhave a different point of view like they did in the Inquisition? Or with \nnatives in South, Central and North America when they imposed their myth \nand killed the natives that didn\u0027t agree with them?","+Tyler Durden relax friend, I\u0027m a biology student about to specialise in \nevolutionary genetics and i hear about \"religious ignorance\" a lot, what I \ndo and my well respected professors do it too: just let them be! Respect \nwhat they have done to our world and forgive what they did wrong, most \nreligious people respect us for that too, Christianity is responsible for \nmany beautiful things, I can look for hours at a gothic cathedral and i \nstudy listening to Bach\u0027s Matthäus passion or Beethoven\u0027s Missa Solemnis, I \ndo know we maintain norms and values in science that are inspired from many \nreligious norms and values, being ethical is a big part of that, what can \nwe do with science and what shouldn\u0027t we do? Let just everyone in their \nvalue because we don\u0027t need a debate between those against and those before \nthings that were absolutely necessary for shaping the world as it is today, \nboth in a good and a bad way, that\u0027s why we study history, to make sure \nthat mistakes won\u0027t happen again and find the good in the past!","+blahh blah\n+Tyler Durden The bible does not command slavery, murder, or killing of \ninfants.*\n\nIt clearly does and Paul tell you not to twist the words and go beyond what \nthey say, you know that, right?\n\n\n*Ultimately, typically leading to many not to even want to have slaves \nbased off of how god wants us to treat each other.*\n\nI wish you were joking but you just either is not honest or you don\u0027t know \nthe USA\u0027s history with slavery.\n\n\n*You have not read the whole bible and even if you did I can tell you don\u0027t \nunderstand it based off what you say.*\n\nI just read it like we should read any book. Critically. If you are to make \nup excuses, like you are doing, then you have to ignore a lot of it.\n\n\n\n*The very fact that you say a perfect world must be understood inside and \nout. This world is not perfect nor is that what god expecta out of each of \nus.*\n\nThat\u0027s not me saying. It the fairytale book itself that says it\u0027s perfect. \nIf it were, everyone would have the same interpretation.\n\n\n\n*Explain it all or don\u0027t just cherrypick a couple of lines and say it \nexplains all of christianity without even putting in context.*\n\nContext? In which context is it moral to kill children? To stone people? \nWhat a \"nice\" moral guide.","+Tyler Durden The bible does not command slavery, murder, or killing of \ninfants. It does give guidelines as to \"if\" you have slaves how to act both \nfor the slave and the slave owner. Ultimately, typically leading to many \nnot to even want to have slaves based off of how god wants us to treat each \nother. You have not read the whole bible and even if you did I can tell you \ndon\u0027t understand it based off what you say. The very fact that you say a \nperfect world must be understood inside and out. This world is not perfect \nnor is that what god expecta out of each of us. If you continue to quote \nthe bible please also explain what is taking place, whom god is talking to, \nwas it man\u0027s decision or did it follow god\u0027s will, where, why, and above \nall don\u0027t just take two linea out of the bible and \"think\" you know or even \nfathom to understand qll of christanity. Just as I wouldn\u0027t quote 2 lines \nout of a cookbook and call myself an expert chef. Explain it all or don\u0027t \njust cherrypick a couple of lines and say it explains all of christianity \nwithout even putting in context. That\u0027s called missed interpreting. \nAnyways, good Mr. Durden.","+Muslim Dude *There is much that can be shared interms of evidence*\n\nI guess we will just disagree on this point since what you call evidence is \nnot really evidence but a confirmation bias.\n\n\nYou seem like a nice guy to talk to. It amazes me to meet people like this. \nIf only most religious people had this mindset.\n\nSo you got Allah as your only true god? What\u0027s it that you call evidence \nfor his existence?","+Tyler Durden \n\n\nTyler:\u003cb\u003eIf only religious people could do the same, but no, they want to \nget their claws over everything on the society and impose their myth.\u003c/b\u003e\n\nI agree Tyler. Most religious people do make their beliefs about their ego \nand go around telling others you are wrong. Which is ironic because the \ncore teachings most spiritual traditions are almost always against egotism. \n\n\n\u003cb\u003eWhere\u0027s the evidence of that? It\u0027s just a fallacy.\u003c/b\u003e\n\n\n\nThere is much that can be shared interms of evidence that highlight the \nsimilarities in belief within religions that has scripture. I advice you do \nsome research on this topic. You may start with this video, which gives \nreferences you can look up about from the old scriptures. \nwatch?v\u003dyEm68Gcumy8","+Muslim Dude\n*Let the man be, don\u0027t attack another person\u0027s beliefs.*\n\nIf only religious people could do the same, but no, they want to get their \nclaws over everything on the society and impose their myth.\n\n\n\n*All the major religions originated from the same One Source and changed \nover time. So if you find similarities, it is because they are like rays \ncast from the same sun.*\n\nWhere\u0027s the evidence of that? It\u0027s just a fallacy.","+Tyler Durden Let the man be, don\u0027t attack another person\u0027s beliefs. Do not \ninflict upon others what you wouldn\u0027t want yourself.  \nAll the major religions originated from the same One Source and changed \nover time. So if you find similarities, it is because they are like rays \ncast from the same sun.","+blahh blah\nA perfect word must be understood from inside out, no matter what part of \nit you choose and the bible isn\u0027t perfect with all it\u0027s atrocities, slavery \nsupport and its genocidal, infanticide god.\n\n\n*Jesus just repeated what was already commanded in the old testament*\n\nNow you choose to say the OT is valid? What about not using mixed fabric, \nstoning people to death? You cherry-pick what fits you best.\n\n\n*God bless you though man. I hope you find peace.*\n\nInstead of mysticism, may your mind be open to reason some day.","+Mike Hunt\nI\u0027m just pointing out what religious people choose to ignore boy. Go back \nto your bed now.","+Tyler Durden Lmao you really get offended by being called out?\n\nIronic how you mention cherrypicking yet you clearly cherry pick all your \nlines LOL.","+Tyler Durden Good except, this was already a commandment waaay before \njesus came upon the earth. Jesus just repeated what was already commanded \nin the old testament. 2. Confuscious believed in heaven to guide him and \ncarry him through ultimately giving credit to god himself by doing so. \nUnderstanding the bible must be read as a whole. You \"trying\" to pull a \npiece out here or there only shows your lack of knowledge. It\u0027s like \nreading 2 lines out of a book that you never read all the way through and \nacting as if you read or understand it. God bless you though man. I hope \nyou find peace.","+Mike Hunt*You\u0027re pulling shit out your ass.*\n\nI was never impolite to you boy. So behave yourself.\n\n--------\nchristians do claim that based on bible verses they cherrypick. Like:\n\n\n_29The most important one, answered Jesus, is this: Hear, O Israel: The \nLord our God, the Lord is one.e 30Love the Lord your God with all your \nheart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your \nstrength.f 31The second is this: Love your neighbor as yourself.g There \nis no commandment greater than these.\n*Mark **12:29**-31*\n\nAlso in Matthew 22:37-40.","+LeonidasSthlm\nLuckily. How good and moral would it be to follow instructions to beat \nslaves (Luke 12:47) and cause family conflicts (Luke 12:51 and Matthew 10:34\n)?","+Tyler Durden What... where is this thinking coming from, I\u0027ve never heard \nof any Christian claiming the belief to treat others how you would want to \nbe treated is solely a Christian ideal. In fact it\u0027s present throughout \nnearly all major religions. You\u0027re pulling shit out your ass.","+Tyler Durden Not really, it\u0027s not like most christians actually follow \nwhat jesus said.","+Mike Hunt\nYep. Yet, christians try to monopolise over it.","Don\u0027t be a dick is pretty much universal and is a philosophy that exists in \nthe animal kingdom let alone being the basic though process for socialising.","+Utony Nguyen Shhhh.

This is a word play on the fact that \"fly\" can both be a noun \n(insect) and a verb (what a bird does) but bird is only a noun.","+Jake Tamang A bird can fly (verb), but a fly (noun, insect) cannot bird \n(not a \nverb).

What\u0027s the joke?","+Darren Ng I\u0027m missing the joke here. Help me out guys.","+TheUglyGnome I think you\u0027re missing the point of the joke. And no they \ndon\u0027t use the same word.","+Darren Ng Did he speak English?

Ekde nun, ni ?iam parolas Esperanton.","I propose Esperanto then :-)","I hope this discussion doesn\u0027t derail too quickly, there are a handful of \ninteresting points worth going over. I do agree that the WWW does influence \nlanguage change in various ways, it most likely does not stop or slow \nEnglish language change. the grammatical and syntactical structure of \nlanguage do change very slowly, but words coming in and out of use, \npronounciation and loanword integration all happen at a much faster pace, \nand the introduction of the web has not stopped this process at all. In \nfact, I\u0027d argue it has sped it up, as it simplifies language exchange and \nintegration.  \n\nWhile we are continually connected in these days, we still have our own \nculture and society we belong to, and these influence our language use \nimmensly. \n\nYour objective definition of language is interesting, but does not fit its \nthe concept as a whole. Language is also used in various other ways aside \nfrom expressing ideas/emotions. If that was the case, implicatures and \nindirect speech would not be a thing. We also use language to command, to \nsuggest, to gain attention, to manipulate, to take action (e.g. \"I now \npronounce you husband and wife\", or \"I promise I will\"), to provoke thought \nwith language manipulation\n and many other functions. You might argue those are all results of \nexpressing ideas, but that is not true, as in cases like above, you do not \nhave the intent of expressing an idea. A better (though still flawed) \nanalogy would be to compare language to a multitool, with little parts that \nmake different tools which can be utilised for different ends.\n\nOh, one final note. This doesn\u0027t really address your main point, but it is \nrelevant for the discussion itself. at one point, you said in your reply \nthe following:\n\n\"I see it as the many different ways to write the number 7.\"\nI wouldn\u0027t say different languages are all different variants to describe \nthe same thing, because the different manners of describing things (be it \nabstract or concrete) actually cause the description to be very different \nas well. To illustrate this, consider how Russian uses no definite or \nindefinite articles, creating ambiguity and/or a more general sentence in \nsome cases. Another example would be how a language like Dutch has the word \n\"gezelligheid\". It can be roughly described as a feeling of comfyness and \njoy in a social situation, but it is not directly translatable in any way, \ncreating a different description altogether when you try to do so.\n\nWhether inter-/extra-lingual diversity is a good thing or not is something \nI\u0027m personally neutral about, so I\u0027m not going to comment on that. ","Oh yeah!  I fucking forgot.  I never said we would \"advance a century every \nday\". (I wish you could hear how mockingly I just said that)  What\u0027s this \n1% shit? Asshole numbers?  What I said was \"collectively\" as in the entire \nhuman race.  Think about the little pygmy people.  \"advance A century in A \nday\", that\u0027s 1 century and 1 day.  So, in other words, the little pygmies \nin New Guinea can learn all about airplanes, computers, astrophysics, \nbiology, blah, blah blah, bleh, meh meh, meh.  I know you aren\u0027t listening \nby this point.  Fuck off kindly.","Oh jeez.  Where to begin...  Obviously I never said anything about \npracticality.  That\u0027s why we went to imagination land.  If we were to \nchoose a language for worldwide communication right now.  It would be \nEnglish.  Not because I fucking think it\u0027s the fucking greatest, but \nbecause it is already accepted as such.  Try to fly an airplane anywhere in \nthe world and you\u0027ll find out quick.  Many developed countries teach \nEnglish as a second language.\n\nAs for being \"evil\", well that\u0027s a cool opinion.  You\u0027re entitled to it for \nsure.  I have one too and it is the complete opposite.  Weird how that \nworks, huh?  If you are thinking I want to go out and crush cultures and \nforce people to speak English then you have an active imagination.  I \nwouldn\u0027t be so quick to put language in the same category as emotions and \nbeauty.  I see it as the many different ways to write the number 7.  They \nall convey the same idea.  I don\u0027t think we need to cry for our ancestors. \n They can\u0027t care less if we forgot all about them.  Just like the universe \nwouldn\u0027t blink if we all disappeared.\n\nLet us not forget the power of the platform we are currently using for \ncommunication right now.  A big factor in language changing over time and \ndialects emerging is failure to communicate outside of your community.  The \ninternet puts us all in the same community.  We may see dialects emerge \nalong websites instead of geographical barriers, but with the grammar \npolice constantly on their guard I can\u0027t see language changing as quickly \nor as drastically as it has in the past.\n\nGod bless the little pygmies down in New Guinea.  But if jungle dwelling \nfolks could talk to computer having folks and they could easily share \ncomplex ideas.  I\u0027d bet the whole farm them little pygmy folk are gonna \nwant to get themselves one too.  And stop living out in the sticks and \npicking berries out of critter poop \u0027cause they\u0027re \"sacred\".\n\nLets take a look at the sliding scale of Diversity.  On the low end we have \n1 language spoken by everyone.  Totally not diverse.  On the other end of \nthe scale everyone speaks their own language.  Ultimate diversity achieved. \n But is this a good thing?  How many languages to how many people must \nthere be to satisfy the diversity gods?  What\u0027s the ratio?  Diversity has \nbecome a buzzword.  If you don\u0027t want diversity then das wascist!  Well, \nnot in this case.  Language is the way we \"measure\" ideas.  Like units of \nmeasurement you want diversity within.  Think about Metric Vs. Standard \nunits of measurement.  If you have a blueprint that uses both you will have \nto translate a lot and probably make more mistakes than if you had only one \nsystem.  So, the Metric system has diversity within it. Being able to \nmeasure very small objects and easily scaling to measure very large ones. \n Language needs diversity within it to express complex ideas.  But you \nwouldn\u0027t want to write a book with alternating sentences of two or more \nlanguages.  Unless your goal is to have miscommunication.  I guess some \npeople just want to watch the world burn.  I, on the other hand, want to \nsee the human race succeed.  I\u0027m not sure what that even means, but I know \nit doesn\u0027t include hating your neighbors because they speak a weird \nlanguage and killing them because they seem less human than you.\n\nEdit: they\u0027re to their before the Nazis.","Look up Esperanto","+pentuplemintgum666 Heh, easier said then done. In theory, you are right, \nit would be infinitely more convenient and logical to do so. However, there \nare multiple problems with this. \n\nFor one, how are you going to choose an universal language? No language is \nuniversally easy to learn for everyone. This is even the case for \nartificial languages specifically created to be simplistic and easy, like \nEsperanto. English is currently the lingua france we use across the world, \nbut not everyone speaks it well enough to use it as a second language, and \nthose who can vary in fluency. \n\nYou might respond with \"You could simply force people to not use their \noriginal mother language. Eventually, as new generations grow up, everyone \nwould use the same language as their first language, right?\" Yes, but aside \nfrom the fact that it is pretty inhumane to force it upon people, it is \nalso difficult to give up a language because it is intertwined with culture \nand tradition. \n\nThen there\u0027s the problem of long-term language development. Every language \nchanges on the long term. Look at Middle English from the 15th century and \nyou\u0027ll quickly realize it is practically incomprehensible for the modern \nday English speaker. If everyone would adopt the same language, you would \nquickly see the rise of different dialects and variations (caused mainly by \nregional variation), and eventually new languages can be created because of \nit. It\u0027s impossible and undesireable to keep a language exactly the same.","+pentuplemintgum666 as long as the language is not english","+pentuplemintgum666 there are more than 2000 languages in our world. how do \nyou think that would even be possible?","That\u0027s stupid and evil. We would not advance a century every day. Maybe \n1%more growth. The cost for translating within the EU institutions for \nexample amounts to 1% of the EU budget. As for the evil part linguistic \ndiversity might be a practical hindrance but so are emotions, identity, \naesthetics, and pretty much everything that makes life worth living. \nDespite the practical costs, linguistic diversity is beautiful and sacred.","+Loïs Jotry here\u0027s a study about disadvantages for creativity, in case \nyou\u0027re interested: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3212749/","+Loïs Jotry yeah but on the other hand I forget words in my native language \nor say expressions wrong.

But people found evidence \nthat the world was indeed a circle and not a sphere and NASA never truly \nsent back any pictures of the earth. How would you take this, if you \ncouldn\u0027t refute their evidence, and their evidence suggests the world \nprobably is a circle, would you believe it?\nWould you be willing to change your entire view of the shape of the world, \njust because one person presents you with evidence that it is a different \nshape? Or would you ignore that person?\n\nAnd I will state that while miasma theory does sound silly now a days, bad \nsmells could correlate with bacteria. \"Smell that rotting meat over there? \nIt smells terrible better mask the scent, remove the scent, or dispose of \nthe object.\" Sadly the prior was somewhat common. But sometimes they used \noxidizing agents to remove the scents, these actually would have killed \nsome of the bacteria. And if they disposed of the object, well that would \nhave removed a threat of infection.\nMiasma wasn\u0027t a bad idea, it just had a misguided part to it. \n\nSadly in the case of John Snow, before the handle was removed he only had \ncircumstantial evidence, and after the handle as removed, even if they \nchose to believe him they would be reluctant to believe him. After all it \nwould take a lot of time and money to allocate into digging a new well, or \nmodifying/ removing the old cesspit. And if they announced it to the public \nthey would then be pressured into doing it whether they had the funds or \nnot, and they were elected officials. So they have plenty of reasons to not \nwant to believe Snow.","+xxuncexx The problem is that pseudoscientists then use this idea to try \nand push their BS, even though they don\u0027t have the evidence to back up \ntheir claims.

At the beginning I thought you were another \nstupid troll. Very funny man. You really deserve a thumb up. Excelent \nanalogy of the creationism-evolution issue. That\u0027s exactly the same logic \nthat the creationists always use.","+Edwin Luciano While your general point is valid, be careful with your \nactual history. The example of Galileo is not a good one for this instance \nbecause the geocentric model of the cosmos that was accepted by scholars \nthroughout the ancient and early modern world was the Ptolemaic model, \nwhich was a thing of mathematical beauty. It was not some silly theological \nidea but a system that accounted for all observable data and it was \nmathematically sound and elegant. Galileo\u0027s heliocentric model, on the \nother hand, was a mess that did not account for a large number of serious, \nobservable phenomena, such as Mercury going retrograde and elliptical \norbits. However, Galileo had a piece of technology, the telescope, which \ngave him enough additional observable data to prove the Ptolemaic model was \nfundamentally flawed. \n\n\nGalileo made wild and false speculations to account for the problems of his \nmodel, which, when combined with the fact that it took time for the \nscientific community to build telescopes to verify him, made it vary hard \nfor anyone to take him seriously at first (Ockham\u0027s razor was against him). \nThis was not helped by the fact that Galileo was impatient and inflammatory \nin his claims/attacks, which caused the academic community and, in turn, \nthe Church (who followed the judgement of the experts) to respond before \nthey had the evidence to make a more measured judgement. \n\n\n\nIt was not until Maxwell in the late 1800\u0027\u0027s that we were able to actually \nsolve these serious mathematical problems with the heliocentric, and even \nthen, the end result was much less elegant.","+An Elf If your point is that people are assholes, you won\u0027t get any \narguments from me.","+Edwin Luciano Society\u0027s attitude toward science new discovery has not \nchanged one bit. While skepticism is science\u0027s greatest value and source of \ntheir discovery, the general population does not share this view, and \nworst, they do not trust science as much as they should.\n\nTake tobacco for example, for many decades science had continuously \npresented nicotine, the chemical within tobacco, have side effects like \naddiction and lung cancer. People do not listen to scientists. They listen \nto the CEOs of these tobacco companies who with straight faces lied and \ncontinue to convince people to buy their products. Climate change is also \nanother example. The media and opponent consistently say science is \nincompetent and there is no consensus that Global Warming actually exist. \nThere is a consensus, and so far, no scientist has been able to disprove \nit. But society listen to everyone else, not the science. \n\nA pro gun activist say people use guns in self defense more than 2 million \ntimes a year, when a doctor present a record they treat gun wounds less \nthan 400 thousands a year. A nude model claims vaccine gave her son autism, \nand parents become paranoid and refuse the treatment for their kids which \nhas saved countless of lives.\n\nThroughout history, you can find many scientific discoveries that are used \nand taught today, but heavily scrutinized during their time of discovery. \nHippocrates, father of medicine and every doctor today must make \nHippocratic oath to enter the profession, was sent to jailed because he \ndisagreed with illness as a result of evil spirits or divine punishment. \nGiordano Bruno was burned at stake. Galileo was house arrest. Charles \nDarwin and his family was denied by church and health care. The problem is \nnot the science, but the belief system and how the general population are \nresistant to new idea.","+Lukas Berglund , I wouldn\u0027t say *everything* we knew about physics a \nhundred years ago is wrong. For example, Galileo\u0027s assertion that all \nobjects fall at the same rate of acceleration in a vacuum was proven once \nagain to be correct by an experiment done on the moon by astronauts who got \nthere with the help of Newton\u0027s laws (which are still used to launch \nspacecraft today). Newtonian mechanics aren\u0027t *wrong* they just don\u0027t work \non a quantum level. \n\nThe problem with Miasma Theory, in my opinion, isn\u0027t that it was wrong, it \nwas that it wasn\u0027t based on verifiable and falsifiable data. Nobody did \nexperiments to demonstrate how poisonous clouds made people ill. And the \ncase of cholera should have been particularly troublesome since it isn\u0027t a \ndisease that attacks the respiratory system which is what you would expect \nfrom toxic air.\n\nI would say that the problem wasn\u0027t that everybody believed something that \nwas wrong but that they believed something that happened to be wrong for \nthe wrong reasons.\n\nThat may be true about some beliefs today but not too many scientific ones, \nI don\u0027t think.\n\nOne of the things that has changed is our attitude towards these things. \nToday we don\u0027t really know why colds are more common in the winter. \nScientist readily admit this fact of nature is not understood very well.","Today it\u0027s been more a good 400 years since the Scientific revoluton, but \nit\u0027s been shown that everything we believed in physics a hundred years ago \nis wrong through quantum physics. A core philosophy of rationality is that \nnothing can be known for sure. As Stephen Hawking said in a brief history \nof time: \"Any theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a \nhypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of \nexperiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next \ntime the result will not contradict the theory.\"\nOf course some theories work so well that you don\u0027t have to consider them \nbeing untrue when using them, but we shouldn\u0027t repeat the mistake shown in \nthe video and refuse to consider a countertheory when there is evidence for \nit. ","+Lukas Berglund I\u0027m not a historian but I know that for a long time in the \nWestern world what was \"true\" about the natural world was \"true\" because of \nwhat authorities on the subject said was \"true.\"\n\nThen Galileo came along and turned the way we found out what was \"true\" on \nits head. \n\nSo it\u0027s no surprise to me that many things we believed in the past, \nespecially before the Scientific Revolution are now shown to be false, \nbecause the way we find out what\u0027s true and false changed thanks to the \nScientific Revolution.\n\nBut as we make our way into a scientific way of looking at nature (I know \nDr John Snow lived centuries after Galileo) I think it\u0027s going to be harder \nand harder to do what Dr Snow did: change the way everybody thought about a \nwidely accepted natural occurrence.\n\nI say that with the knowledge that many people still believe that you catch \na cold if you don\u0027t bundle up in the winter. Old ideas die hard. But \nscientists know and accept that it is a viral infectious disease that just \nhappens to be more common in winter for a host of reasons.","Throughout history we have been learning that our beliefs are wrong all the \ntime. What are the odds that at exactly this time in history we have come a \npoint where almost everything we know is true? That has never been the case \nand I doubt that it suddenly is. \n\nWe can still use our models of reality as long as they predict what we see, \nbut we have to be ready to accept new models if they are more accurate than \nthe old ones. ","+Merry Machiavelli The last line in the video gave me the same impression. \nThe whole \"which theories that are accepted today are crap?\" question \nsuggests that there may be big reversals in commonly accepted theories.\n\nI think it was Richard Feynman who said that keeping an open mind was good \nbut no so open that your brains fell out.","How is that so?

I think it\u0027s a very good one.\n\nI knew you were talking about *pubic* schools when you said that before \n1962 prayer in school was \"okay.\" And I knew what you meant by \"okay.\"\n\nBut the point I want to make is this:\n\nIn this great country of ours, you are allowed to read the Bible if you \nwant, to believe what it says, if you want, to believe in some parts and \nnot others, if you want, to read it for fun, if you want. And you can do \nall of these things even in a public school. \n\nIf you want to pick up a Bible and read it in the Library or during lunch \nbreak in any school in America, *nobody* can stop you. And I would give my \nlife if I had to make sure this is the case even though I am an atheist. \n\nWhy? Because I believe in the freedom of religion.\n\nBut I also believe in the freedom *from* religion. It\u0027s illegal to teach \nthe Bible the way it used to be taught for good reason. For one thing, why \nnot teach the Book of Mormon, the Koran, or any other number of religious \nbooks? Why should the Jewish students in the class have to sit through \nMatthew, Mark, Luke and John if Christian students don\u0027t have to sit \nthrough the Mishna and the Gemara.\n\nYou can\u0027t teach all the holy books so you shouldn\u0027t teach any. Because \nteaching the Bible and not teaching every other single religious text is \npromoting the Bible over every other religious text. And that\u0027s why even \nthe Bible as literature is problematic. \n\nHell, we can\u0027t even have kids read *Huckleberry Finn* by Mark Twain without \nshit hitting the fan!\n\n----\nPrayer in the public school is the same. Students are free to pray in \npublic schools. If you want to say a prayer in your head while in Math \nclass nobody can stop you (nobody is even gonna know). If you want to pray \nin your \"free time\" nobody can or should stop you. Thousands of teams in \npublic schools have prayers before and after games. There is no problem as \nlong as somebody who is being paid by the school isn\u0027t initiating it.","+Edwin Luciano Let me think...National Education Defense Act of 1962..... \nhm that sounds a lot like public education...I wonder... Maybe I am wrong, \nbut most people would understand that something that comes from the Federal \nGovernment about education is dealing with PUBLIC school. for get it... we \nare going to debate this back and forth and neither of us is going to \nconvince the other that we are right, when sometime I think that we are \ntalking about the same thing and agreeing.\n\nOh next time you see a veteran thank him or her for your freedoms.","+Lorie Franceschi *YOU* wrote \"Yet until 1962 it was okay to pray in \nschool.\" If you mean *public* school, then write *public* school. It\u0027s just \nsix more letters to type.\n\n\nI\u0027m not jumping back and forth, I\u0027m responding to what you write. I\u0027m not a \nmind reader.","+Edwin Luciano Again I am talking about public education. You are jumping \nback an forth from private and public schools. make up your mind.","+Lorie Franceschi I suggest that you apply the same rules to others as you \napply to yourself and vice versa. \n\n\"Yet until 1962 it was okay to pray in school.\"\n\nIt\u0027s still okay to pray in school. Catholic schools have students pray all \nthe time. And in public school, if a student wants to say a prayer, nobody \ncan or should stop them. What you can\u0027t have is school employees leading \nthe students in public prayer. Which if you know your Bible, Jesus says is \nthe stuff of hypocrites. (Matthew 6, v 5-6)\n\nSchool prayer initiated by the school in a public school is not \"okay\" now. *It\u0027s \nillegal.* And it was never \"okay.\" People allowed school prayer* in public \nschools because they didn\u0027t understand the Establishment Clause of the \nFirst Amendment. They allowed the segregation of public schools before 1954 \n(Brown v Board of Education) because they didn\u0027t understand the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIt did take court cases to figure that out but we did figure it out. It\u0027s \nsettled law. You ain\u0027t gonna get no Bible in public schools no more.\n\nIf I understood you correctly, you spent six years of your life defending \nthe Constitution of the United States. That\u0027s fantastic! I\u0027m glad people \nlike you make that sacrifice. It\u0027s a shame not all of you understand just \nwhat the hell you\u0027re defending!\n\n\n*School prayer initiated by the school.","+Edwin Luciano You really need to read what is in both yours and my \nstatements. How do you know that MY Bible is the one that was taught in \npublic education? You don\u0027t. You need to study up on public education and \nthe bible before you start spouting off again about either one. It is the \nlaw of the land via the 1st amendment that\n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, \nor of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" 1789. Yet until 1962 \nit was okay to pray in school. The national education defense act does not \nstipulate which religion could not pray anymore it just states that there \nwill be no prayer. \n\nYou really need to educate yourself about the public education sector and \nthe role the Bible within it. \n\nI suppose that you want gun control too I might be wrong and if I am i am \nglad.","+Lorie Franceschi \"I spent six years defending the right of all Americans \nto worship as they feel is correct, but don\u0027t push it on any one else with \nout their permission.\"\n\nAnd just what the hell do you think having a Bible class in a public school \nis?

If it\u0027s going to be in any \nclass, it should be a part of a philosophy class, along with the Quran, the \nTorah, and the Vedas.","+Edwin Luciano Actually the Bible is NOT part of the public education \nsystem any more. The Bible was part of the American public education system \nfrom 1647 when Massachusetts opened its first public schools, until 1962 \nwhen the Supreme Court removed school prayer. That looks like 315 years to \nme of the Bible in public schools. Ever since then the morals of the \nAmerican society have gone down hill and that is why we have the \"me\" \ngeneration and their parents that give in to them. That is an observation \nfrom many people that I have talked to from many different walks of life.\n\nAnd YOU were telling me how to teach my children:\n\" If you cannot afford to send your child to a religious school or you do \nnot have access to a religious school that you would want your child to \nattend, you can always have your child learn about the Bible at Church \nor at home  parents and homes are part of your children\u0027s education \ntoo! \"\n\nYou know nothing about me or my children. So please do not tell me how to \nraise my children.","+Kar Weng The problem is that pseudoscientists then use this idea to try \nand push their BS, even though they don\u0027t have the evidence to back up \ntheir claims. I can\u0027t even count the number of times i\u0027ve run into the \"But \nscience was wrong on other things\" argument, which is then used to claim \nall of the rest of modern science is wrong because they say so.","+Lorie Franceschi *My statement* was about your first statement and I will \nquote it for you:\n\n\"...the bible was part of the education system also. \"\n\nNotice that at no point in my comment did I mention evolution once.\n\nApparently you *do* need to be told that you can send your children to a \nreligious school or teach them about religion at home or church because you \nand many other Americans seem to lament the absence of the Bible in our \n*public* education system while ignoring that teaching religion in *public* \nschools violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of our \nConstitution.\n\nI repeat, the Bible *still is* part of our education system. And since I\u0027m \na *pick yourself up by the bootstraps* rugged individualistic American who \nloves the Constitution and believes in the rule of law, I insist people who \nwant the Bible to be taught to children just go right ahead and teach the \nBible to children. \n\nIn short, if you want it taught, teach it your damn selves. Just don\u0027t ask \nme to have my tax dollars to pay for it.","+Edwin Luciano My statement was about the public education system. The \nteaching of evolution was frowned upon for most of our country\u0027s life. It \nwas not until the 1958 National Defense Education Act signed by President \nEisenhower. this Act came about because our federal elected leaders were \nafraid that the USA was falling behind the USSR in education. \nI do not need to be told that I could send my children to a religious \nschool. I do not need to be told that I am responsible for teaching my \nchildren the morals that are taught in the Bible. Please be so kind to get \noff your high horse about telling me what i need to do with my children. \nYou are not part of my family and really have no say as to what I teach my \nchildren. Besides the \"NE\" generation, telling people how to raise their \nchildren is part of the problem we have today in this country. Good Day.","+Lorie Franceschi The Bible still is part of the educational system in my \ncountry, the United States. If you want your child to learn about the Bible \nin school, you have the perfect right to send your child to a parochial \nschool. The Churches who run them don\u0027t even have to pay taxes.\n\nBut in my country, the United States, we have a set of laws, called the \nConstitution, which prohibits the government from getting into the religion \nbusiness. So governments cannot fund public schools which promote religion \nand therefore public schools promote no religion of any kind. That\u0027s what \nreligious schools are for.\n\nIf you cannot afford to send your child to a religious school or you do not \nhave access to a religious school that you would want your child to attend, \nyou can always have your child learn about the Bible at Church or at home  \nparents and homes are part of your children\u0027s education too! \n\nIt\u0027s my understanding that some organizations hand out the \"Good Book\" for \nfree.\n\nAt home and at Church is where most people learned about the Bible for most \nof history since the Bible was canonized. That\u0027s where *I* learned about \nthe Bible and I think it\u0027s a perfectly fine place to learn about the Bible. \nBibles in schools are a relatively new invention.","+Kar Weng It did not used to be that way. the bible was part of the \neducation system also. We have seen what happened in that category. Asking \na question is frowned upon 99% of the time now in schools. Mainly, new \nteachers are not taught what they need to know in the subjects they teach. \nLook at Math, by the time kids are in middle school, they are so dependent \non calculators, they can not do their math facts (multiplication facts of \ntwo one digit numbers) without one.","+Kar Weng Hungary - Atheist\nthe country has many kinds of different peaceful religions - only the \ngoverment is pushing it a bit in talks\nthe scool system is set up over trivial knowledge - and has little to \nnegative funding\naltho in many places the scools are alright, and there are private level \nbut govermental (free for the best - we get you in if youre good) ones, but \na lot of them are just barely ok\noh yes, and discrimination against gypsies - almost forgot that one... a \nlot of them just didnt blend in at all","Malaysia, a muslim country in the Asia Pacific. I\u0027m a Chinese and also an \natheist so I\u0027m quite the minority here. My parents, friends and schools are \nnot very supportive of critical thinking.","+Kar Weng That is not the case in France or in Switzerland. The education \nsystems push critical thinking more than anything. I assume that\u0027s the case \nin most of western Europe.

Men sound \nmuch worse IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE AND BE SEXIST","+Plain Popcorn You are wrong again.  I presented one side in regard to what \nI believe is morally righteous.  I advocate a woman allowing the embryonic \nlife in her to continue to term enjoying a life out of the womb having \nnothing to do with their feelings.\n\nJustice has nothing to do with your feelings.  Some people don\u0027t like it \nwhen they get ticketed for speeding.  So what?  Who cares how you feel. \n You are doing something dangerous and against the law.  It was in that \nspirit I was arguing against terminating a pregnancy produced by rape.\n\nI NEVER suggested that all women would be happy with the pregnancy that was \nthe result of a rape.  NEVER.   You brought feelings into it and I \nresponded by highlighting feelings that are never or rarely reported on.\n\nAs far as assumptions go, I made one about you to your chagrin but you did \nnot realize you made one about me.  Again you mischaracterize my position. \n I never said that all women favor the baby, obviously they all don\u0027t if \nsome get abortions.  This is common knowledge.  I simply showed you the \nside of the coin that gets forgotten.\n\nNow you are insulting me as I have not insulted you saying that you doubt I \ngraduated high school when in fact I have graduated college with honors.  I \nhave a degree in philosophy.  So keep burring yourself in your own \nhypocrisy.  I never called you a coward, you just insinuated that due to \nyour hypersensitivity.  Barbarism is in war correct?  I am not saying there \nis not such thing as a just war, but even the just ones are brutal, cruel, \nand horrific.  This is why the military must always demonize the enemy.  It \nis very hard to kill.  Now I do think abortion is wrong, but it being \nbarbarous is just a neutral fact, get over it.  I am not going to sanitize \nmy language to make you feel comfortable.  You are way too sensitive.  That \nis why abortion is called abortion instead of murder.  This euphemism makes \nyou feel better.  Abort means to stop, what are you stopping intentionally? \n LIFE, that is murder.\n\nNow my example of the baby delivering stem cells to damage cells draws on \nthe exact same premise as a fetus manipulating the blood supply.  BOTH ARE \nEXAMPLES OF A STRONG GENETICS CONTROLLING THEIR ENVIRONMENTS. The baby is \nstrong enough to save it\u0027s host, and strong enough to manipulated nutrient \nrich blood.\n\nMy reading comprehension is just fine.  THAT IS WHY I ALREADY DEALT WITH \nYOUR PERSONHOOD CHALLENGE.  Remember when I gave you examples of a person \nin a coma?  Remember I gave you examples of a Buddhist monk that can clear \nhis mind of thoughts because thoughts were your criterion?  Now you want to \nchange your marker for personhood and say a person needs a past, \nexperiences, a personality, feelings, and a future.  Okay that sounds like \na fetus.\n\nIf you want to play that game about personality, okay lets play then. Some \npregnant woman play classical music and the baby leaps, personality.  A \nbaby has a past in the womb (I will no longer give you a pass on that).  Is \nreality only outside of the human body?  Organs aren\u0027t real? They feel \nbecause they react to the burning solution that are poured on them to \ndissolve them.  They have a future, that is the crime of abortion.  They \nare robbed of their future.  As far as thoughts go, they may not have \ncomplex thoughts but I bet you they respond to voices.  That is basic \nrecognition displaying base level thought.\n\nOne point on feelings.  If you need feelings to be a person, what about \nsociopaths?  What about a girl with a rare condition where she does not \nfeel pain.  Are they not persons?  Again if you are going under for \nsurgery, and you don\u0027t feel anything as you are unconscious, are you \ntemporarily not a person?  Is your personhood suspended for a bit? \n\nYou should realize by now how slippery a term  personhood really is to the \nintelligent.\n\nAccording to your definition my dog is a person.  He has a past, feelings, \ncan think, has a future, and has a personality.  Most mammals are persons \nunder your definition.\n\nAny more insults as I shut down your arguments like a drunk\u0027s liver?","+excusia \"I simply did WHAT YOU DID, which is present one side of what some \nexperiences of woman undergo look like.\" We didn\u0027t start from the same \npoint though. You presented only one side earlier on, I reacted by \npresenting another side. It would not have benefitted anyone for me to \npresent the side you presented as well since it was already talked about, \neven though I do recognise both viewpoints as equally valid. That\u0027s why I \nleft it out. So no, we are not the same when it comes to that.\n\n\nTbh, you don\u0027t sound like you\u0027ve ever been sexually violated if that is the \nonly side you wish to present. If you had been it would make a lot of sense \nto at least think about all the major viewpoints of that situation. I find \nit hard to believe that the only side you ever give any thought is \"imma \nkeep this baby\" when the scenario of pregnancy through rape comes up.\nNormal people think about multiple angles in such situations, even when the \nsituation is just an imagined scenario. So yeah, I do find it hard to \nbelieve that you understand the gravity of such situations, makes me think \nyou\u0027ve never felt the sting of being sexually violated.\n\n\nYes you did say SOME women (later on), but you did not address what the \nOTHERS might feel like. That reads to anyone that that is where your \npriorities lie, and it makes it seem like you can\u0027t imagine what people who \nmake other choices may feel like. If there is a view that opposes your own, \nit\u0027s valuable to understand that view and where it comes from. But instead \nyou mention me alleviating myself of guilt, and that goes to show you see \nabortion in such cases as cowardice and ultimately the wrong the decision. \nYou want to paint the raped woman getting an abortion as the bad guy, \nbecause she is taking something that is only a person in potentia. I \nunderstand your viewpoint, I simply don\u0027t agree with it.\nI on the other hand didn\u0027t have to describe your viewpoint, because you \nalready did it.\n\n\nYou started painting your viewpoint with this: \"An abortion is trauma to an \narea where she already received trauma.  In many ways that child may even \nhelp her heal from an attack being a silver lining.  If not she can still \ngive it up for adoption. \"\nWhen you talk about trauma you\u0027re trying to make the point that she \nshouldn\u0027t have an abortion because extra trauma. Nobody wants extra trauma \namirite? Can\u0027t be a good thing.(sarcasm, obviously). IMO in some cases the \ntrauma of carrying a rapist\u0027s offspring, having this unwanted pregnancy \nforced upon you can be far greater than the trauma caused by a legal \nprofessional abortion.\nWhere in this bit do you talk about SOME women, where do you even entertain \nthe option of someone making a different decision?\n\n\n\"it has the exact same amount to do with to the topic of a period than does \na fetus controlling a woman\u0027s nutrient blood flow.  You seem to allow that. \nIt is just as relevant\"\n\nI remember them explaining it is relevant because menstruation weeds out \nthe inferior fertilised eggs that if not weeded out would put a strain on \nthe woman\u0027s body. If a strain is to be put on a woman\u0027s body by pregnancy, \nit better be because of a strong fertilised egg and not a inferior one. \nIt\u0027s about minimising the risk of a bad outcome. They did not include the \nbenefits of the stem cells because the whole video is about how \nmenstruation minimises risks. The video is not about benefits of pregnancy \nor menstruation in general or about pregnancy in general.\n\n\n\"Past experiences don\u0027t make you alive or dead people would be alive.\" You \ndon\u0027t seem to get it. It\u0027s not about being alive or not. Like I said in my \nprevious comment, it\u0027s about personhood and the rights that come with it. \nAnd yet you claim that your reading comprehension hasn\u0027t suffered since you \nattained it. Which isn\u0027t saying much to be honest, you could have not \nfinished high school for one.\n\nAnd where have I ever said or insinuated that life on its own is the \ndeciding factor in whether something gets to live or die?\nI never did, and you\u0027re operating under false assumptions again.\n\n\n\"Okay so you realize that a newly born infant that just comes out does not \nhave a past if you are not willing to count the womb\" But it does have a \npast, and it has feelings and thoughts. It is a person before it comes out \nof the womb. At some point (not sure how many weeks/months) a fetus \ndevelops to a stage where it gains the ability to feel, think and process. \nThey may not happen all at the same time but it\u0027s way after 12 weeks.\n\n\"An infant that just comes through the womb does not manifest any \npersonality.\" Not true, please go and read something about personality \ndevelopment in children. Personality is also shaped by genes (not just \nenvironment), and this part starts expressing itself before birth.\n\n\"because they have no language skills at that point\" They think in images, \nsounds, sensations. Even adults are still able to do that aside from \nthinking in language.\n\"They have feelings, but then again so does a fetus.\" yes and no, there is \na point where the fetus has no feelings, there is a point where it gains \nthat ability and from then on it will have feelings.\n\n\n\n\"As far as insulting you, I did not\". I\u0027d say accusing someone of cowardice \nand a commitment to barbarism is insulting. It may not be a cussword (aka \ninsults) but it\u0027s a way of insulting someone nonetheless. \nThe same would be if I accused you of being a selfish person committed to \noppressing other people and violating their rights to choose a future if \nthe rape pregnancy scenario happens. Whether it is true or not, I\u0027d say \nthat\u0027s still insulting without using cuss words. If you smear a person\u0027s \npersonality to such a level it\u0027s only normal to be a little bit insulted, \nno need for oversensitivity. I didn\u0027t say I felt really insulted, just a \nsmidge. And only a smidge because what you said wasn\u0027t actually true. If it \nwere true I would have owned it.\n\nAnd a classic way of getting out of responsibility, insult someone and then \nsay \"it wasn\u0027t an insult, you\u0027re just too sensitive\". \nAsking someone politely to reread a previous comment is not an insult, \nespecially when it\u0027s so clear that the other person is misinterpreting \nthings wrongly time and time again. Neither is addressing confirmational \nbias.\nFor a conversation to do anything both parties need to understand and \ncomprehend what the other is saying. I have explained this before.\n\n\nYou may write whatever you want, I\u0027m not going to respond because you don\u0027t \nknow enough about abortion, and the stages fetuses and unborn babies go \nthrough, to have such an outspoken viewpoint on the matter.","+Plain Popcorn My reading comprehension has not suffered since I attained \nit.   You said, \"It\u0027s obvious you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be violated \nsexually. Otherwise you wouldn\u0027t be saying that.\"\n\nThis statement operates with the presupposition that YOU DO KNOW.  Now just \nbecause you later expressed that some women feel put upon by a rape \npregnancy does not excuse your polemical statement that I obviously don\u0027t \nknow what it\u0027s like to be violated sexually, which by the way is an \nassumption, how do you know?  I simply did WHAT YOU DID, which is present \none side of what some experiences of woman undergo look like.  I made the \nsame claim of saying SOME WOMEN.  So perhaps your reading comprehension \nneeds a tune up. \n\nTo your point about what does a fetus having the ability to repair a \nwoman\u0027s damage organs have to do with the video, it has the exact same \namount to do with to the topic of a period than does a fetus controlling a \nwoman\u0027s nutrient blood flow.  You seem to allow that. It is just as \nrelevant.  Both deal with pregnancy the reason for periods.  She dealt with \nthe dangers of pregnancy, which is fine, but left out the benefits, which \nis suspect.\n\nPast experiences don\u0027t make you alive or dead people would be alive.  You \nmoved the goal post and made your position even more shakier.\n\nYou said, \"This person in the coma is an actual person with a past, a \npossible future, a personality, opinions, thoughts, feelings.\"  \n\nOkay so you realize that a newly born infant that just comes out does not \nhave a past if you are not willing to count the womb.  I reject this \npossible future business, because if that were a real criterion of yours, \nyou would allow for a unborn child the possibility of having a future.  An \ninfant that just comes through the womb does not manifest any personality. \n All babies cry, crap, and sleep.  No opinions, no thoughts in the sense \nyou are thinking of, because they have no language skills at that point. \n They have feelings, but then again so does a fetus.  You should see them \nsquirm when they are stabbed in the back of the head, it really looks like \nthey don\u0027t like it.\n\nAs far as insulting you, I did not.  You perhaps are just too sensitive. \n Time for a thicker skin.  It actually is you who question my intellectual \nprowess.  Maybe you don\u0027t like my tone but that is hardly an insult.","+excusia \"However you know that life is every bit valuable and the of the \nsame essence under twelve weeks than it is over twelve weeks.\" Life doesn\u0027t \ntranslate directly into personhood and rights for me. And it doesn\u0027t for a \nlot of people. To me where a fetus is in development is actually important \nto the argument. Read that part again in my previous comment where I \nexplained my stance on personhood and beings with no past, no thoughts etc.\nI understand your position and viewpoint, you don\u0027t seem to understand \nmine. It\u0027s like you actually think that I have the same opinion on life as \nyou do, you arguing from that assumption is not going to go anywhere except \ncreate more misunderstanding.\nYou don\u0027t have to agree with me, but understanding what my actual viewpoint \nis is crucial to the conversation. You can\u0027t just assume we think and feel \nalike.\n\n\nYou also think I am alleviating myself of guilt, whilst you could not be \nmore wrong. I actually think it is fair to allow a woman pregnant from rape \nthe CHOICE to carry the pregnancy to term or to choose abortion. As in, the \nchoice should be up to her.  \nI was merely illustrating what it is like for the women who do want the \nabortion in such a case, because you don\u0027t seem to understand their \nfeelings and what it means for their future. Put yourself in those women\u0027s \nshoes, and not just the women who do want to carry the pregnancy to term \n(or even raise the child).\nTo me forcing a woman against her will to carry a pregnancy from rape to \nterm is sacrificing the life of an actual person for the life of something \nthat is only a person in potentia at under 12 weeks.\nWhat seems just to you seems like injustice to me.\n\n\nYour accusations of cowardice (alleviating myself from guilt and so on) and \nbarbarism don\u0027t sit well with me because they\u0027re simply not true. They are \naccusations made under the assumption that we are alike, you make those \nbecause you don\u0027t grasp my stance or even seem to know from which frame of \nreference I am operating under.\n\n\n\"Not only that, if someone is in a coma, they can not think, are they \nalive?\" Technically they are alive, but if they are braindead they have no \nfuture. Best to pull the plug then IMO. If they are not braindead it\u0027s \ndifferent. This person in the coma is an actual person with a past, a \npossible future, a personality, opinions, thoughts, feelings. This is what \nmakes them different from a fetus under 12 weeks.\n\nYou keep asking \u0027are they alive?\" but you fail to see that life on it\u0027s own \ndoes not mean much when it comes to rights. It\u0027s clear you are stricken by \nanother misunderstanding here.\nPlants don\u0027t think, yet they are alive. Does that mean I shouldn\u0027t eat \nthem? Does that mean their life has the same value as a human\u0027s? \n\n\nIt\u0027s obvious that you have poor reading comprehension, no I don\u0027t speak for \nall women, I was very clear when I was explaining what someone COULD be \nfeeling and experiencing during a given situation. I choose to illustrate \ntheir point of view because a few comments ago you did not seem to be able \nto understand their position and feelings. If it had been clear that you \ndid and saw both points as equally valuable I would not have mentioned it.\nI don\u0027t invalidate the experience of those who choose to carry that \npregnancy to term or even raise the child and I never even insinuated that, \nI only argue that the choice should be theirs and not something forced on \nthem.\n\n\nAs for your stemcell bit \"See what I mean, it is not all just science, \nbecause if it were that would be included.\" Why should they include it? Why \nis that related to why women have periods?\nI think you suffer from comfirmational bias here, it seems as if you think \nthat if they do not cater to what you think should be included it is \nbecause they have ill will.\n\n\nIf you choose to respond (you don\u0027t have to) to this conversation that \nprobably is a road leading to a dead end, not of benefit to either of us,\nplease:\nA- good reading comprehension, please do it. Reread my previous comments if \nyou have to (if this comment hasn\u0027t made your view of my viewpoint any \ndifferent you should go back and read the previous ones). If you respond \nwith the same wrong assumptions about my point of view you\u0027re just wasting \nmy time and I will be aborting this conversation.\nB-leave the insults at home or in your church, write them on a note and \nthrow it in the trash or shout it out of your car window on a lonely road \nif it makes you feel any better. One reason is that you might be wrong and \nmake those insults because of misunderstandings. Another reason is that it \nmakes a civil conversation go down hill.","+Plain Popcorn One last thing, and you don\u0027t have to respond.  If a mother \nhas damaged organs an unborn child can send stem cells to repair them.\n\nWhy didn\u0027t this video mention that?  I just learn that today.  See what I \nmean, it is not all just science, because if it were that would be included.","+Plain Popcorn You can try to set up an arbitrary starting point to \nalleviate yourself of guilt that comes with that commitment to barbarism. \n However you know that life is every bit valuable and the of the same \nessence under twelve weeks than it is over twelve weeks.  That is like \npretending that an apple has nothing to do with an apple.  \n\nUnborn children have the complete genetic complement that is necessary for \nforensic identification. If you were blown up in a terrorist attack, and \njust a trace amount of your flesh was found, they would ID you by your DNA. \n Everything is there, it just a matter of time and building.  If you buy a \ndesk that needs assembly, is that a bait and switch?  Can you sue Ikea for \nselling you something that was not a desk?\n\nNot only that, if someone is in a coma, they can not think, are they alive? \n If someone is profoundly retarded are they alive?  Buddhists can clear \ntheir minds of thoughts when they meditate, are they temporarily dead? \n Thinking is not the measure of life.  Plants don\u0027t think, they are alive. \n Ants are instinctual machines, they are alive. Life if bigger than your \nmistaken marker.\n\nIt\u0027s obvious that you think you speak for all women. \n\n Layne Beachley is a seven-time World Champion Surfer who\u0027s mother was \nraped.  So just tell her she was wrong and has no idea WHAT SHE WENT \nTHROUGH.\n\nValerie Gatto is Miss Pennsylvania 2014. Valerie Gatto, was 10-years-old \nshe found out that she had been conceived by rape. Gattos mother was \n19-years-old when she was raped at knifepoint. When Gatto was in the third \ngrade her mother told her, Something bad happened to me. A very bad man \nhurt me, but God gave me you.\n\nOKAY BUT YOU KNOW BETTER THOUGH!  \n\nI am not saying this is every woman\u0027s experience, I just don\u0027t pretend to \nspeak for them all.  Some draw strength and joy from the baby, not the \nrape.  Other draw pain from them both.  I don\u0027t invalidate the experience \nof those that don\u0027t match up with my view.","+excusia Like I said, we won\u0027t agree.\n\"An abortion is trauma to an area where she already received trauma.  In \nmany ways that child may even help her heal from an attack being a silver \nlining. \"\n\nIt\u0027s obvious you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be violated sexually. \nOtherwise you wouldn\u0027t be saying that.\nSome women might choose to bring the pregnancy to term, others will have a \nstance of \"get that thing out of me right now!\". And I firmly believe that \nthey should have access to abortion for that.\nRaising a child is a constant reminder of what happened, looking and \nfeeling your changed body after birth is a constant reminder of what \nhappened, as is going through the whole birth process.\nThe feeling of being violated usually only increases when you have to have \nthat child you don\u0027t want by that person who did that to you. You only \nincrease a rapist\u0027s influence and power to maim and terrorise if you do.\nAfter all the tests have been done (std test, police gathering evidence of \nrape on the body) a lot of the times an abortion allows a woman to move on \nand start healing again.\nAnd what silver lining does a 12 year old girl see in birthing a child? I \nmean come on now, not all rapes happen to adults.\nI was fertile from around my eleventh birthday, at the age of 12 I was \nalready getting unwanted attention from men over 18 years of age. Turning \ndown their advances would sometimes be met with negativity and threats. \nTeenagers getting raped is not a small percentage of all rapes.\nAnd just because you can get pregnant at that age doesn\u0027t mean your body is \ndeveloped enough to allow passage to the baby, teenage pregnancy under 16 \nis often riddled with complications some of them lethal.\n\n\nI don\u0027t think a baby/fetus/cellcluster under 12 weeks in the womb has the \nsame rights as the mother in case of rape.\nI don\u0027t think personhood applies to beings that have no past, no thoughts, \nno feelings, no sense of awareness. \n\n\nI can\u0027t believe you would force such a situation on a woman who has already \ngone through so much, to have to carry that to term, to have to be ripped \napart in the nether regions during birth, changed forever after that. I \nthink a woman should have a choice to abortion in such a situation.\nYou ask me if Eartha Kitt\u0027s life is less valuable than yours or mine, IMO \nher life is now of equal worth, but that bunch of cells that would become \nher wasn\u0027t her just yet at under 12 weeks.\nLike I said we won\u0027t agree.\n\n\nAnd what does the bible have to do with it? Is it to illustrate your \nopinion? If so it has no other function and it should have no other \nfunction.\nWe\u0027ve made our opinions known, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll change our minds doing \nthis. If you have any questions you\u0027re welcome to ask but don\u0027t expect us \nto agree on this and surrounding topics. I think our values are too \ndifferent. \nYou could think me cruel that I would think a woman\u0027s life is worth more \nthan her \"baby\u0027s\" life at under 12 weeks in the womb in the case of rape, \nlikewise I think it\u0027s cruel that you would force such a situation on a \nwoman.\nWe both think the other is wrong, so I think it ends there now doesn\u0027t it.","+Plain Popcorn \n\nEartha Kitt was conceived by rape.

Kill the rapist.   He is the one the \ncause the trauma not the baby.  An abortion is trauma to an area where she \nalready received trauma.  In many ways that child may even help her heal \nfrom an attack being a silver lining.  If not she can still give it up for \nadoption. ","+excusia Oh you\u0027re from the US? If so that makes your frame of reference a \nbit different from mine. I\u0027m from the netherlands and even though we have a \nfew conservative people here, the right to abortion and contraceptive \naccess has never been in any danger from the 70\u0027s on.\nBut as you agree, abortion isn\u0027t a black or white issue if you try to do \ngood by people.\nYou say yourself that it\u0027s okay when it\u0027s medically necessary to save the \nlife of the mother.\nSome people won\u0027t even have that, they say it\u0027s a black or white issue.\n\n\nI say in case of rape or medical necessity that abortion should be legal to \ndo. Naturally the latter is far more common than the former.\nIn the case where \"people have unprotected consensual sex and don\u0027t want a \nbaby yet get pregnant anyway and then opt for the abortion option\" well \nyeah I disagree with that practice (and luckily it\u0027s very uncommon here \nbecause the people are so educated about the precautions they can take) but \nI would not go so far as marching against the right to abortions.\nAs far as I know people don\u0027t really march with the message of \"abortions \nshould only be legal in case of rape or medical necessity\".\nAnd that doesn\u0027t stop the people from the last example to get illegal \ndangerous abortions.\nThe more I read and write about it, the more I see it can\u0027t be black and \nwhite if you\u0027re someone who cares about justice. And also that people can\u0027t \ncome to an understanding with each other about it, the issues divides \npeople.\nYou might disagree with me on the abortion in case of rape issue, but if \nthat is the case I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever agree. I think it\u0027s wrong for a \ntraumatised woman to have to carry the seed of her attacker to term. If you \nforce that cruelty on to her that\u0027s the kind of thing that leads to \nsuicide. If done early enough I think the life of the woman has more right \nto exist than the life of bunch of cells without the ability to feel or \nthink.","+Plain Popcorn Abortion could never reach the status of a right without \n the strong arm of feminism.  This video was really just trying to \nreinforce subtly to women that abortion is natural and pregnancy is mortal \ncombat.  \n\nWomen are more split on abortion that any other issue.  It just does not \nseem like it because the media is in the bag for pro-abortion interests.   \n According to a CNN the poll pro-abortion crowd is waning.  They show that \n58 percent of Americans oppose abortion is all or most cases.\n\nIt is easy to point to exceptions and try to uphold a reckless practice, \nbut if the standard is beneficial to most people most of the time, it is \nbetter to stick with that.  \n\nIs it okay to run a red light to flee from a driver that is shooting at \nyou?  Of course, but that is an exception.  I think most would agree the \nvast majority of people the blow red lights are dangerous and careless \ndrivers.","+excusia \"Woman mostly do celebrate pregnancy, and it is this subtle attack \nthat aims to change their minds\" I don\u0027t this video is changing anyone\u0027s \nminds into not having children. \nWhen people really want to have children there is no internal tug of war \n(or at least the woman does not perceive it as such) since the pregnancy is \nwanted and the side effect are just the price they have to pay for \noffspring. \nI can imagine that, in a situation where a woman is pregnant against her \nown will, and if she is particularly stricken by pregnancy side effects \nthat she does perceive it as a tug of war.\nIn the developed west that situation may not be common though.\n\"Remember women needed to be convinced that abortion was a right and a \nchoice\"\nI also remember learning at school that some women marched against the \nright to vote (instead of for it, can you believe that), and that women \nmarched for the right and access to abortions and opportunity to buy \ncontraceptives (the pill, iud etc). The latter didn\u0027t need to be convinced \nthat abortion should be a right and a choice in their eyes.\n\n\nAs for your other points, they\u0027re probably valid. I have not payed any \nattention to the usage of \"baby or fetus/whatever you wanna callit\". I \nusually assume that they use the terms most fitting, and that no personal \nfeelings should enter the science field. I didn\u0027t pay it any mind as I have \nmy own opinion on when those terms should be used.\n\n\n\"Notice how the mother has an angry face when the narrator says that the \nmale genes promote their own survival?  She is glowering at her husband\"\n\nI thought that was a weird thing to include in the video. I assumed it was \na throwback to the times when women got pregnant against their will and she \nis angry that her mate saddled her with a little nutrient stealer that made \nher fatigued. Not really relevant in modern society. At least IMO it \nshouldn\u0027t be.\nIn some ways being pregnant does make it harder on a woman to take care of \nher other children. Being pregnant usually does suck the life right out of \nyou, even though it\u0027s also a joyous state to be in when the pregnancy is \nwanted.\nUnplanned bleeding and weak cervical plugs are pretty common during \npregnancy and bedrest is usually prescribed to prevent miscarriage, you can \nimagine it\u0027s difficult to do all your chores and take care of your kids \nthen. My mother had it, my partners mother had it, my current pregnant \nfriend had it.\nHopefully the women can call upon family and friends to care for the \nchildren in the meantime. But not everyone has such a social network they \ncan rely upon, sadly.","+Plain Popcorn Discussing the dangers of pregnancy is okay just as long as \nit does not get personalized like the narrator has a habit of doing.  \n\n For example if I have cancerous cells inside of me, I don\u0027t need to make \nthem villains with black hates twirling a handle bar mustache.  It is \nhematopathology and nothing more. \n\nIt is a curious thing to me that when it comes to robbing an unborn child \nof life in the womb, we tend to make him or her a thing.  It is not a \nchild, it is a fetus, embryo, or blastocyst.  I notice the narrator calls \nthe fetus a child when it does things she likes.  However when IT does not \nthen IT is a fetus.   \n\nThe language is deliberately manipulative.  There is no conflict of \ninterest in pregnancy like the video suggests.  Things can go wrong in any \njoint endeavor.  This language is meant to make you feel like a mother is \nfighting her unborn child.  There is no tug of war.  When your body \nredirects blood from your extremities to your vital organs, is it a tug of \nwar between your fingers and toes on one side and your heart, lungs, and \nliver on the other side?  No!  Body parts don\u0027t fight,  Your \nparasympathetic nervous system just manages the best situation it can. \n Notice how the mother has an angry face when the narrator says that the \nmale genes promote their own survival? Side note, all genes promote their \nown survival. She is glowering at her husband.  Now men are part of the \nproblem.  How does a baby extract \"more than his fair share?\"  Oh yeah they \ncompared a human mother to a kangaroo and a bat.  Their pregnancies are \nfair because they can expel their children (abortive envy).  That is the \nmost telling part of the video. That is the crescendo! Abortion is natural, \nit can not be immoral! WE ARE NOT ANIMALS!  They go on to say that a mother \nwant to provide equally for all her children as if this terrorist baby is \nstopping her benevolent plans of caring and sharing.\n \nWoman mostly do celebrate pregnancy, and it is this subtle attack that aims \nto change their minds.  Remember women needed to be convinced that abortion \nwas a right and a choice.  This is propaganda.","+excusia I didn\u0027t take it pro-choice phraseology. How would you have liked \nthem to describe the dangers of pregnancy? Should they actually add \"but it \ncomes with benefits\"? \nDiscussing benefits of pregnancy isn\u0027t really essential to the discussion \nof why women have periods.\nThe feelings of the mother don\u0027t really fit into the discussion either.\n\n\nAs for a celebratory understanding of pregnancy, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s seen \nas that mostly.\nEverywhere around me women are either pregnant, just gave birth or want to \nbe pregnant... aside from the ones who have enough kids already.\n3 days ago a new nephew was born, my best friend is pregnant and she is \nreally happy with that. She was emotionally distraught when she had a \nmiscarriage. \nOther friend just found out that she\u0027s pregnant and the whole family was \nhappy.\n\n\nThe only person I know that had an abortion didn\u0027t really want to have one, \nbut she had to since her baby had a genetic disorder and the baby was \npoisoning her from the inside out. Both she and her baby would have died \nbefore the end of term. It was not a joyous occasion.\nThis is my frame of reference,\nIf I find out large % of the fertile female population is taking abortions \nlightly I will let you know.","+Plain Popcorn Let me be very clear, all the information is spot on.  My \ngripe is with the framing of a child and mother relationship in hostile \ndescriptions.  They want to instill an acrimonious understanding of \npregnancy instead of a celebratory or even just neutral one.\n\nAs a person who is against abortion, I recognize the pro-choice dog whistle \nphraseology.","+excusia I don\u0027t think the facts in this video (fetus or unborn baby being \na potential threat, like the danger you mention) are presented from a \npro-abortion viewpoint. They are presented as is, no judgement made. \nAlthough some people in the comment section may describe the fetus or \nunborn baby as a parasite, I believe that is made in jest because of the \nterms used in the video.","+Plain Popcorn\nCan\u0027t find it!

But in the video, they said that not all mammals have periods. ","+Shawn Ravenfire For some animals that don\u0027t get periods:\n\n\n1.) Some animals like most fish species don\u0027t give LIVE births but they lay \neggs outside their body and the males just simply swim over the eggs and \nfertilize them. So there would be no need to cleanse out the uterus \nlining/their reproductive systems since the baby isn\u0027t going to be \ndeveloping inside of them\n\n\n2.) Some animals like sponges or jellyfish are ASEXUAL, meaning that they \ndon\u0027t need another partner to be able to reproduce. Some can reproduce by \nsimply budding and branching off, there\u0027s no need for sexual organs; \ntherefore no sex organs to cleanse out via a period.\n\n\nThe reason only mammals have periods is that we have our babies develop \ninside of us (as opposed to outside our bodies like chickens or fish laying \neggs), we give live births, we need 2 different sex cells (egg and sperm) \nto reproduce so we are not asexual (we need sex organs to facilitate the \ntransfer and implantation and incubation of the fetus, hence we also need \nbiological feedback mechanisms to be able to cleanse our systems to \nmaintain peak performance/quality of our organs at all times -\u003e the idea is \nthat our bodies always try to prepare us for any possible future events \nsuch as child-bearing by keeping our systems healthy and in-check).","+???\nok, thanks","+fuge74 Parthenogenesis is IMPOSSIBLE in mammals as they (and we) reproduce \nsexually by MEIOSIS. We NEED 2 separate and different strands of DNA to \ncombine in order to trigger fertilization process. When a female has her \nperiod even after having sexual intercourse it usually signifies that \nfertilization was not achieved and so everything is cleansed out and starts \nover again. A failed embryo CANNOT survive and undergo further cell \ndivision due to certain cellular mechanisms that has to take place prior \nthat. Also embryos NEED to actually be fertilized by sperm first before \neven undergoing cellular division -- a simple egg cell cannot just suddenly \nstart to divide and multiply by itself (to create a baby); the only \nexception to sudden out-of-control cell division are cancer cells.","Pretty much","+Sunny shine Soylent green?","we need to start eating humams not growing more.","+Philipp Jay I think the pill helps a lot in this issue.

That way older kids can choose an \nindependent life, they have the freedom to move out of their parents, and \nlive at school, or get their own house if they can afford it. Child \ndiscrimination is actually extremely prevalent, whether it is practical is \ncompletely up to debate.

We don\u0027t want to be \ncommunist but all capitalism and only capitalism doesn\u0027t lead to liberty. \n\nIt leads to  slavery, preventable health related death, poverty, and many \nother ills. \n\nLook at the Usa. Least educated populace among first world countries. \nHighest death rate among first world countries, highest amount of gun crime \namong first world countries, most expensive health care perhaps in the \nworld, highest infant mortality among first world nations. You guys can do \nsoooo much better than that.. \n\nI once talked to an american friend who\u0027s head had been hurting him for the \npast two weeks straight. I said, go to a hospital, get it checked out it \nmight be something serious. \n\nHe says he can\u0027t. \n\nI\u0027m like why?\n\n\"Because going for a check up costs a months rent. I can\u0027t afford that.\"\n\nI was shocked...\n\nYou mean to tell me simply going to see if something is wrong means \npossibly becoming homeless!? He could be dieing!\n\nYou call that liberty? You call that freedom?! How is he more free than \nmyself, who can stop at a doctors office free of charge? \n\nThat doesn\u0027t sound like liberty, that sounds like a nightmare. surely the \nright to be protected from early preventable death is just as important as \nthe right to own a gun? \n\nI felt so bad for him, and a little mad. What if he had a brain tumor? What \ngood is liberty if you don\u0027t have health?

At the end of the day someone has to \nprovide that service thus making it a very important commodity and not a \nright.)\n\n\nI get what you are saying, but hear me.\n\nYou could apply that to a lot of things. like, the right to security. Lets \nsay you have a country that is lawless, kids are being kidnapped, women are \nbeing raped. Just the worst.\n\nWould not a police force also need to be provided by some one? Could you \nnot sell security as a commodity? say you pay x money to some guy  with an \narmy and he\u0027ll protect you in return? In fact now that I think about it, \nthats exactly how things worked in the feudal area. So you could sell \nsecurity as a commodity.\n\nBut does that mean the people do not have the right to be secure? Just \nbecause you can sell it? \n\nFreedom could also be turned into a commodity. like when in some societies \nslaves could buy their freedom. but just because you can sell freedom, \ndoesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not a right.\n\nI guess what I\u0027m saying is. Yes, you can take away peoples rights. We\u0027ve \nbeen doing that for thousands of years. But that doesn\u0027t mean we should. \nSome things people should just have because they are VITAL.\n\n\nI feel education, health care fall under what we should have. If you don\u0027t \nwant to call em rights fine, but they are so VITAL that it would feel wrong \neven wicked for them to not be provided to everyone to some degree. I \nunderstand that taking from others to give to others may not be your cup of \ntea. But I dunno. if I where a king  and taking 10% of everyone\u0027s income \nwould save and improve the lives off thousands of my people so vitally. \nShould I not put the well being of the kingdom above one individuals \nrights? \n\nIf you where a king, and education and basic health care was only possible \nfor everyone buy taking 10% (Or 5 or 4 what ever.) of every ones income. \nWould you really choose an uneducated populace with terrible health Just to \nprotect a few well off people?\n\n(Is it morally right or wrong to force said individual against their will \nto take their kidney? If a government took the rights of some against their \nwill to help others. Does anyone in that country really have any rights at \nall? )\n\nHmmm...what we are dealing with is conflicting rights. I\u0027ll use the \nsecurity argument again. health care and security are both equally vital \nIMO, in fact more people will die from illness today then from war or \nviolence. You I assume are okay with the notion of your taxes going to \nsupport the military/ police ect because they are also vital.\n\nBut if education and health care are just as vital. Then...why is it okay \nto take money for one and not the other? What if I don\u0027t want to pay for \nthe military? What if I live on a boat and will never need the fire \ndepartment? why does the government have the right to take my money for \nthings I don\u0027t need or do not support? Are my rights not being infringed \nupon?\n\nThe truth is my friend everyone has their rights infringed upon a little \nbit for the good of the collective. It\u0027s needed, so I don\u0027t protest my tax \ndollars going to the military  or the fire department. or for roads. (I \ndon\u0027t need to drive.) Because I understand these services are vital. I \nsimply think health care and education are just as vital, if not more so \nand should be funded at least until we find an alternative.\n\nThink of it as a necessary evil if you must but we need it..","+lieutenantbears\n\na thoughtful comment.\n\nI will chew on this and give you my thoughts.\n\nMight I say this hasn\u0027t become a flame war kudos.","+zlkimagenX The main points im trying to make is the difference between \nrights and commodities.

At the end of the day someone has to \nprovide that service thus making it a very important commodity and not a \nright. \n\nWe might not like to admit it, but education and healthcare are expensive \nand someone has to pay for it. Medical research and schooling is very \nexpensive and we as a society have to find a way to pay those expenses. Im \nsorry to hear about your aunt and I understand that we as a society have to \nhelp the sick and poor, but, the hard truth is we cannot force people into \ngiving up some of their rights for others.

I mean how much of the shit that you learned in \nschool did you even you even use still?)\n\nI agree with you half way. But in order for you to cater to a childs \nstrength you need to first figure out the childs strengths. That means \nteaching them every subject possible for years. A young child for example \nmay not be developed enough to be taught deep history or math, but might \ndevelop a great talent for it at a later age. public school introduces \nchildren to many free programs and allows them to better discover them \nselfs than home schooling. for example how can you have a drama club at \nhome? unless your parents like drama which they may not. I for one don\u0027t \nplay instruments, what if my child has a latent musical talent? public \nschool gives him a chance by making music mandatory for all students (for a \nshort while.). After a year if you don\u0027t like it you stop. \n\nYour idea of a personal tutor is great but wouldn\u0027t every tutor need to \nknow how to do art, drama, history, music in order to see which child may \nhave inherent talent at a particular subject?\n\n\n(If a different kid has a talent and passion for art why waste and time or \nresources teaching them chemistry? We should be helping them excel at \nmaking art.)\n\nAgain I agree, but I think it would be a gross mistake to not teach \nchildren about say...the history of this nation. Or world war 1 and 2. Also \nI think every child should at least know the basic maths and sciences ect, \nso if the art career isn\u0027t working for them, they can still get a job in a \ntrade like say..plumbing. And live off that until they get their art \nrecognized. So every child would need (SOME.) education in each subject to \na degree.\n\n(How much do you think it costs to kick a ball around anyway?)\n\nNothing, but how much do you think it costs to buy and upkeep hockey \nequipment? especially since children will grow out of old equipment. How \nabout goal posts? pay coaches and referees? insure against injury on the \nfield. Or to buy and maintain instruments for the musically inclined, buy \nmusic sheets, pay for music lessons ect.\n\nIf you are living pay check to pay check, that costs a lot. If your kids \nare in public school it costs nothing. public school provides all of these \nfor free. allowing poor children to enjoy the same opportunities as rich \nkids. \n\n(I mean how much of the shit that you learned in school did you even you \neven use still?)\n\nTrue, very true. But if I may, I took a creative writing course in public \nschool. Turns out I was really good at it, still write stories to this day. \nMy mother at the time could not have afforded and would have never thought \nto enrol me in a creative writing course. It\u0027s thanks to public school that \nI found this gift.\n\nMy brother found football through public school. none of my family plays \nsports, we would have never thought to enrol him in a foot ball club even \nif we could afford it. Its Thanks to public school he found his passion.\n\nand my youngest brother found his love for computer and tech through public \nschool, again free for him to try. he would never have tried that with a \nprivate tutor unless we payed for that subject, which we can\u0027t afford \u003c.\u003c.\n\nSo public school gives everyone at least a base line to get started.\n\nIt allows students to try new things free of charge.\n\nAnd haven\u0027t even touched on the social benefit of public schools, how am I \ngoing to treat X demographic as an adult if I never meet them at home? (I \nlive in a very white area.)\n\nThen again...I live in Canada, maybe american schools are worse than I \nassume?

I\u0027m not an expert on \nthis, correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but those things are not defined as \nuniversal rights.","+TickedOff Priest\n\nI know that. But if the government does not provide education. Does that \nnot exclude those who are too poor to afford private school?\n\nBasically, do kids no matter how poor have the right to at least get basic \neducation? thats what I\u0027m wondering because if the answer is yes. Then I\u0027d \nsay it is a right.","+zlkimagenX There is a world of difference between saying that you will not \nprovide something and specifically excluding a group.","+lieutenantbears\n\n\n\"People have a right to the opportunity to be educated\"\n\nOkay...so in the case of children from poor families who can not afford \nprivate school.

Great argument buddy :^)","+zlkimagenX Lets try to clarify this:\nPeople have a right to the opportunity to be educated. There should not be \na law that stops people from the opportunity of education.\n\nOn healthcare, people should have a right to the opportunity to have it, no \nmatter what, because if you deny healthcare because of race or ethnicity \nthat is discrimination. Although healthcare is very important, the service \nitself is a commodity not a right. It is a commodity because it is a \nmarketable item that satisfies wants and/ or needs. \nBasically, if you can sell it, it is a commodity not a right.","+Naveen \n\n\nIntresting, so if the government decided it would no longer fund school to \nsay a particular minority.

Does she not have the right to receive help? \nregardless of her wealth race or religion?","+IMSMRTR wow you\u0027re an idiot","+Naveen To me,I think healthcare and education is more of a group right \nthan an individual one.\nIf anything,healthcare and education should be free since it is good for \nthe economy overall.\nPeople who provide these services should get paid via taxes.\nBut then again,tax evasion is a huge problem to this approach.\nAt times,there will be businesses who hide their funds so that they don\u0027t \nneed to pay so much on taxes.","The government can and does.","life liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the only rights needed","+elvisitor wikipedia","+Paki Stan \"The Protocol entered into force on 1 April 2005 and has (As of \nJuly 2009) been ratified by 17 member states.

If the limit is something like not being able to threaten \npeople sure, but if it\u0027s something like not being able to express your \npolitical view than quite the contrary. When people are pissed off, they \nare usually gonna find a way to express it. It\u0027s better that they express \nit with words than with guns. An interesting feature of freespeech is that \nit cuts both way, meaning that if you say something offencive or stupid, \npeople can respond back with more speech by pointing out flaws in your \nreasoning or by ridiculing you. You will notice that the exceptions to \nfreespeech in the west are usually cases in which speech can not be \nproperly responded with more speech, such as lying during a commercial deal \nor threats.\n\nOn another hand, Saudi Arabia makes strong restrictions regarding speech \nabout religion which is actually quite dangerous.

And I agree also that \neven scientific studies need to have those involved in the research be able \nto agree on what\u0027s appropriate behavior in order to work together.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nI think that\u0027s a reasonable concern to have. People will always try to find \na reason to do evil and escape punishment and will use any excuse they can, \nincluding \"I couldn\u0027t help it.\" However, it actually isn\u0027t a contradiction \nto simultaneously hold freedom to be of value and to also dismiss free \nwill. I personally hold freedom to be the most important value in the world \nto the exclusion of all others, but I mean that in the sense of individual \nliberty. My other Google+ account is evidence for just how strongly I \nbelieve that.\nhttps://plus.google.com/+HenryMillerParadigm\nI meant to use that account to comment on this video, but I messed up. I\u0027m \ntotally on board with your position that people shouldn\u0027t be subjected to \ninvoluntary interactions. And I would go even further than you by saying \nindividual freedom should be respected in every conceivable situation no \nmatter age or mental fitness or state of mind. You suggest your position \nmight be dismissed as just your belief, but mine would be a great deal more \nthan merely dismissed. I intellectually understand that there is no such \nthing as objective moral truth, but I sure don\u0027t live that way. I like your \nmoral beliefs more than anyone else\u0027s I\u0027ve ever talked to.","+Henry Miller\nNo problem, most people would assume so as that is usually the case, after \nall this is YouTube.\n\nI got what you mean, ethics cannot be determined from the scientific \nperspective, including research ethics, but obviously there can be many \nother belief systems like you said, and I think they are not necessarily \nalways mutually exclusive, and without agreement about ethics even \nscientific studies cannot be conducted as most of the time (or maybe almost \nalways) research is group work now.","+Henry Miller I just fear people will look at the determinist argument and \nabsolve themselves from any interactions that may be viewed as unsavory. I \ncan see how you could hold that view and still go on living a normal \nexistence but I think for many it would be difficult, since freedom is a \nvalue I find many hold dear (or at least would like to think they do).\n\nI dont know why it did a strikeout effect. I noticed that too after I \nposted\n\nI may contradict what I said earlier but I think the way positive \ninteractions should be maximized (if you can call it that given that you \nwouldn\u0027t actually be increasing them given the method I\u0027m about to propose, \nalthough I would like to think it would lead to an eventual increase) is by \nfocusing on eliminating involuntary interactions. Although voluntary \ninteractions can be negative too, I think most people will find them \nundesirable so that they will be of minimal concern (they should really \nonly concern the individuals for those that care for those participating in \nthe interaction). I dont think people should be subjected to involuntary \ninteractions (aside from the necessary early interactions they have with \ntheir parents during development and following or closely preceding the \ninitiation of force) but that could probably be dismissed as just my belief.\n\nYoure right though, I can see major shortcomings in just aiming to \nincrease the net positive interactions between people.\n\nGlad we agree on some things haha. Thanks for entertaining a dialogue with \nme. You\u0027ve given me quite a bit to digest.","+Mohammad Tausif Rafi \nI really thought your intent was to be offensive rather than to make a \nlegitimate point. It should be me apologizing. Sorry to assume such things. \nNext time I\u0027ll ask.\n\nIt is fundamentally true that all belief systems are made up of one or more \nprinciples from which logical inferences and conclusions can be made. \nPrinciples themselves can\u0027t be verified or disproven, even if another \nbelief system draws those kinds of conclusions; they\u0027re just assumed true. \nMy belief system is the philosophy of the scientific method and it doesn\u0027t \nallow for the uncertainty of objectivity. If two people\u0027s belief systems \nare fundamentally incompatible, then they fundamentally are limited in \ntheir ability to come to an agreement about everything.\nIt is true that from my perspective, the perspective of science, there can \nbe no rights. Almost everyone accepts the perspective that rights can exist \nand that they can apply to everyone. Almost everyone is wrong. It is the \ncase many people believe some things are true, but that doesn\u0027t make them \ntrue. Might makes right; that is the truth. It is a truth that makes me \nvery unhappy; not unlike the true statement that suffering exists and that \nit is theoretically impossible to eliminate it for all of time, but it is a \ntruth nonetheless.","+Toah Ewok oops, sorry for being a dick. Yeah, I agree people rarely change \ntheir minds in these kinds of interactions. But you and Henry Miller gave \nme a lot to think about and I enjoyed talking with y\u0027all. I may come off as \nstubborn but I enjoy a good argument and would like to think I\u0027m open to \nchanging my mind as better arguments come along. Even if no one here was \nlikely converted to either opposing viewpoint, I recognized where there \nwere some holes in my thinking of the problem and it seems like a few \nothers did too. Keep on keeping meaningful discussions alive, even in the \ndark corners of the interwebs \\m/","+The Choler of Chloë \n\nI wasn\u0027t being serious and I apologise if I offended you. However, has \nanyone ever actually been convinced that they are wrong on the Internet. \nNever mind YouTube, in fact never mind the Internet because in most \nsituations people are stubborn and think they are right. That\u0027s not saying \nthey\u0027re wrong, because the subject is subjective. The only effective way to \nchange people\u0027s opinions is to have power and influence and talent. You \nneed to be charismatic, likeable, at least appear to be intelligent if you \naren\u0027t actually. There\u0027s just no point to bickering, if you really want to \nchange the world then learn to be a really good writer or speaker and make \npeople respect you.","+Toah Ewok I don\u0027t see why talking about morality via social media should \nbe off-limits or why its discussion should be reserved to intellectuals \nsince it\u0027s of value to us all. You should realize though that dismissing a \nperson\u0027s argument because of their lack of credentials isn\u0027t actually \ndisproving the argument itself. Being condescending is a great manipulative \ntool to subjugate people with dissenting opinions if they\u0027ve had little \nexperience with identifying arguments but your personal attacks do little \nmore than to expose your emotionality around the issue.","Just another day in the YouTube comment section folks, wannabe \nintellectuals debating morality and the nature of free will.","I did not use a tactic to show your point is worthless, sorry if it seems \nso. I meant it is possible to have an even more uncertain position about \neverything than that apparently held by you here, but will that be helpful? \nFrom your perspective, there can be no rights really, while I agree that \nphilosophically it is a more fundamental issue, is it truly relevant while \nconsidering which rights should be considered as something everyone should \nhave, because it is obvious that they have already accepted a perspective \nwhere rights can exist? Sorry again if I have offended you.","+Mohammad Tausif Rafi?\nOne \"tactic\" that is sometimes used to dismiss an opponents argument is \njust that: to dismiss it and deem it unworthy of consideration. You\u0027re \ndoing just this by calling my issue pointless. This approach offers nothing \nthoughtful to challenge the argument. It\u0027s unimaginative, lazy and suggests \nan inability for critical thinking. This video has as its central theme the \nargument that people have inalienable human rights. Not only is the issue I \nraise *not* pointless, it is *exactly* on point. The very fact that \nobjective moral truth is a philosophical issue with no apparent solution is \nexactly the reason why I\u0027m saying it shouldn\u0027t be used as a reason for \nbelieving it makes someone\u0027s moral position correct. And I never even \ncalled into question objectivity itself. It\u0027s strange for you to do so and \nthen state that it\u0027s a pointless question while implying I\u0027m missing the \npoint or straying off topic by bringing up issues that no one\u0027s even \ntalking about.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nI dont want to talk about determinism either for the same reason as you, \nbut I will say *I* dont believe I act as if I have free will and Im able \nto function in this existence just fine.\n\nI would call rape involuntary as well; the victim doesnt have the *kind* \nof agency I think is important in order to say their situation is that of \ntheir choosing, while the offender *does* have the kind of agency I think \nis important in order to say they are worthy of blame. So I agree with your \nconclusions there. It was actually never my aim to compare rape with the \nstress of arguing online though (not that Im actually stressed). You saw \nit that way and I agree with you that that would be flippant.\nI like your use of +/- as a shorthand to describe interactions which \nproduce pleasurable and negative reactions respectively in the brains of \ntwo interacting parties; it fits with my analytical way of thinking. I \nwonder why the markup language let you write minus/minus the first time but \nnot the second and instead did its strikeout effect?\nI like the distinction youre making between innate morality and objective \nmorality. Thinking about it that way makes a lot of sense to me. Describing \nresponses of stress and of pleasure as being the source of our innate \nmorality just sounds right. I cant say I agree though about it being a \ngood idea to maximize positive interactions between people. For instance, I \ncan conceive of someone who would experience extreme distress at being \ndenied the opportunity to cause me harm. They might feel more distress than \nI do at the pleasure at avoiding said harm. At the same time, their \npleasure at causing me harm might outweigh my distress at being harmed if \nmeasured by a scientist. But I can say I positively like your personal \nanswers to my moral dilemma scenarios. There isnt much I disagree with you \non that. I feel our feelings about whats right and whats wrong might \nactually be closer than it seems.","+Henry Miller Is there objectivity? You know, it is possible for one to \nperceive everything subjectively and think they are being objective? You \ncan also consider the issue of whether there is even an external world. \nThese are philosophical issues with no apparent solution, bringing these \nhere is pointless, sorry to say.","+The Choler of Chloë\nJa. The Free Will VS Determinism discussion is like brain in a box levels \nof jerkoff pointless. Either way it has no effect on how anyone should live.\n\nWhether I chose to type that or the universe just crafted me to think I \nchose to type that I still went and typed it.","+Henry Miller Freewill is a whole nother can of worms. Id rather not \nstart talking about determinism. Not because its uninteresting, I just \ndont feel like expanding this further than we already have. Plus, even if \nit is valid, its not a very impactful truth, since to be able to function \nin this existence we need to be able to act like we have freewill. But for \nthe purpose of distinguishing rape versus stressing about internet \ncomments, scientifically you could show they differ in their effects \n(although there is some overlap). And in science, you can still talk about \nthe exercise of choice. If you talk to me online, we both make a choice to \ninteract with each other. It can be a mutual interaction where we both find \nbenefit in talking to one another, or it could be +/- or -/- as perceived \nby the individual (and there are physical effects from this). With rape, \ntheres always a negative in the interaction (you can never have two people \nin a room rape each other at the same time, therefore rape cannot be a \nmutual interaction), and thats why I feel comfortable calling it \ninvoluntary, although you can call it what you want. The fact that this is \nuniversally true implies that on the gradient of right and wrong, rape will \nalways be closer to wrong relative to some other types of interactions \n(what I would call voluntary interactions) where you can have a +/+ or if \nits a +/- or a /, one of the parties at least has the choice to leave that \nis independent of the preferences of the other. So, I would make the case \nthat there is a difference between what we call voluntary and involuntary \ninteractions, and moral arguments really only apply to the latter. So, \nusing these criteria, we can have at least some kind of standard for right \nand wrong. The relative nature of it isnt so much a problem, since in \nscience you can have things be relative to a standard. For example, if the \naverage lifespan of a male in a certain country is 72, if we notice a male \nwho only lived to 50 in that country, we can say he had a short lifespan. \nLiving to 50 relative to past standards though, that may be a long \nlifespan. The fact that it was once long and is now short doesnt make the \nfact that its considered short in the present untrue. It is always true \nthat at that time period where the standard age of death is 72, anything \nbelow that is short. For morality, the aim is to increase positive \ninteractions between people. Where we can maximize positive interactions, \nthis can be said to be more moral or right than the alternative.\n\nYou may say that the interaction between people all comes down to personal \nperception of the two involved in the interaction. I dont think thats the \ncase. For example, you can have two people observe an apple. One observer \nmay say its red and while the other observer, who is colorblind, says its \nbrown. A scientist can measure the wavelength of the light being reflected \nto confirm that red is the color being reflected. So, if one person \nperceives rape as good and not detrimental to the victim, a scientist could \nstill measure physical indicators showing that the sex wasnt voluntary (I \nthink I kind of made this point earlier, and you didnt have a problem with \nit, so forgive me if Im repeating myself).\n\nI think there is universal agreement (since its innate) for us as a social \nspecies that your own life is valuable as are positive social interactions. \nIf you hold life and positive social interactions as valuable, you can say \nthose that initiate force are acting against these values and are wronging \nwhoever theyre acting against and protection of your own life, the life of \nyour relatives, and the lives of your community can be justified.\n\nI feel like there is something to the point youre making and I fear that I \nmay be conflating what may be better referred to as innate morality as \nobjective morality. I still think there is an objective way of creating a \ngradient of right and wrong by looking at the relative effects of \ninteractions. \n\nAlso, my point about you using logic to debate a point isnt a big issue in \nmy opinion; since I think logic comes out of the consistent and universal \nlaws of nature (we wouldnt have logic if we lived in a chaotic world). I \njust wanted you to realize there is a scientific difference between being \nstressed from an online interaction and rape.\n\nAs for your questions about the moral dilemmas you posed, Ill gladly give \nyou my opinion on them. If the couple were to have a kid, it would be \nimmoral, since they realize the quality of their childs life would likely \nbe diminished due to the increased likelihood of pairing recessive \ndeleterious alleles. The child would not have a choice in his/her birth in \nthis situation, so they would be forcing their decision (which everyone \nwould agree is worse relative to the standard, i.e. its worse being born \nknowing youll have defects than without them). Them having a relationship \nthough, hurts no one and actually increases their quality of life (having \nsomeone you love in your life has been shown to increase your lifespan and \ndecrease your risk of negative health factors). The state sentencing them \nto prison is immoral, since they werent having a negative impact on \nanyones life and the state is negatively impacting their life through the \ninitiation of force. Additionally, the state is sending them to prison \ninvoluntarily and stripping them of their choice to have a relationship \nwith the person they love (and who loves them in return). I dont know what \nprison is like in the UK, but in the U.S., the rape numbers are staggering. \nAnyone who is sent to prison has a high probability of getting raped and if \nthat occurs as a result of a non-violent offense, I think most people would \nagree that thats grotesque and that the punishment does not fit the \nactions performed by the individuals (which were benign).\n\nI think drugs should be decriminalized. Since its a voluntary choice, I \nhesitate to treat the use of drugs as a moral issue. Again, sending people \nto prison for non-violent crimes is a moral issue, as the government is \ninitiating the use of force. If the government really cared about the \nindividuals and society (since people come out of prison often worse than \nwhen they went in), they would offer rehab to these individuals. I think \nits ultimately up to the user and the people who care about the user to \nseek help for drug related issues.\n\nThe right thing to do in your hypothetical scenario where a culture has an \nirrational belief is to attempt to introduce rationality to that culture. \nIt wont likely have an immediate effect but if you show the benefits of \nrationality (one being you get to keep your children, which should be a \ndesire programmed into all K-selected animals), in most circumstances, it \nshould trump superstition. In the case where the culture does not value \nrationality or superior arguments, it is likely that the culture is not \ncompatible with the culture that happened upon them and they should remain \nseparate. This is especially true if opposition to superstition makes them \nhomicidal instead of curious.","+asdfers?\nI relate with your feelings that the siblings should vorally be allowed to \nbe together, but instead of being disgusted, I personally have ultra hyper \nüber extra powerfully strong positive feelings when thinking about their \nincestuous relationship. It fills my heart with much joy.\n\nI like the idea of using a word that specifically describes behavior which \naims to optimize human flourishing, but voral sounds a bit like the word \nvore. Maybe I\u0027ll just stick with using the word feelings and describing \nsome feelings as better than others.","+Henry Miller\n\nEwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.\n\nThey\u0027ve a right to marry each other and I wouldn\u0027t stand in the way of it \nsince vorally nonintervention for nonviolent crimes helps maintain a \nprecedent that protects my own relationships; but doesn\u0027t mean I also want \nto ever hear about it.","+asdfers I like that idea. I think I could get behind it.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nActually, all actions are involuntary insofar as there\u0027s no such thing as \nfree will, but that\u0027s not important. Your point of me comparing something \ntrivial to what you and I would agree is terribly evil is a fair point. As \nto your second question: good comeback. I don\u0027t have a defense. But do you \nfeel there\u0027s anything to the point I was making? How do you resolve \nconflicts where both parties feel just as strongly that their position is \nright? I\u0027m interested in your opinion so I have a few examples for you.\nI watched a bit of a documentary on YouTube recently about a brother and a \nsister in the UK who were separated at birth but were reunited later in \nlife. They fell in love and began a relationship and agreed to never have \nkids together. Incest is illegal in the UK. They were charged with a crime \nand sentenced to prison. Or maybe it was just one of them, I don\u0027t \nremember. Some people feel repulsed by what they did and believe punishment \nis right. Some people feel that there\u0027s nothing wrong with it and are \ndeeply offended that they were punished. Certainly the brother and sister \nfeel that punishment is wrong. What do you think?\n\nHere\u0027s another issue: what do you think is morally the right way to treat \ndrugs like coffee and alcohol and tobacco and marijuana? Should people be \nallowed to do those drugs? What about LSD? I\u0027m told it doesn\u0027t have \nnegative health effects. Certainly not as bad as tobacco. Who\u0027s right? The \npeople that feel drugs are offensively immoral, or the ones offended by \nthat way of thinking?\n\nAnd finally here\u0027s a hypothetical I\u0027ve heard about before: Imagine a \ncommunity somewhere that once a year drowns a child in a river because they \nbelieve that their hippopotamus god demands it of them. The children who \nare sacrificed do not want to be sacrificed and suffer unimaginablely \nbecause of it. It is a true fact in this hypothetical scenario that if they \ndidn\u0027t do it but were forced to stop, the community would become enraged to \nsuch an incredible degree that social order would break down completely and \ntheir community would be internally destroyed in a violent and horrific \nway. What\u0027s the right thing to do there?","+Henry Miller\nWell what\u0027s  new word a word I can use then?\nPloral? Nah, too much like plural.\nFloral? Nah, that\u0027s already related to flowers.\nVoral? Sure, I\u0027ll go with that.\n\nPeople shouldn\u0027t act morally if they interpret it as subjective, but they \nshould always act  vorally; which is rationally concerned with their own \nsubjective self interest, vis-a-vis survival. Survival of the self, \nsurvival or a lineage, or survival of an idea.  You can\u0027t always make a \nchoice that\u0027s more moral than others but you can always make one that\u0027s \nleast more voral than others.","+Henry Miller do you want to compare rape to a voluntary interaction? Or \nuse logic and not science to prove a point?","+Toah Ewok when you justify something, it\u0027s because you don\u0027t want others \nto perceive you as wrong (showing you have either the capacity for empathy \nor an understanding of human nature). You wouldn\u0027t have to justify your own \nactions to yourself if you really believed you were in the right.\n\nDisagreeing about something doesn\u0027t make it subjective. We can disagree \nabout the length of a track but it\u0027s still some objective length.\n\nWhat I\u0027m trying to get at about morality, is that as a social species, we \nknow some acts are wrong if we want to survive and live amongst others. \nThere are some arbitrary laws and principles we abide by that are dictated \nto is by religion or the state but there are some laws dictated by nature. \nFor example, if you initiate force against someone, you will experience \neither retaliation or ostracism. Because of the high cost for these kinds \nof acts, we are programmed to use force generally only as it pertains to \nour survival. So, morality isn\u0027t really a preference.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nYour beliefs are causing me to release stress hormones which means they are \nobjectively immoral. You are now morally obligated to change your beliefs.","+The Choler of Chloë Whenever adjusting something, we are still justifying \nit by our own morals. The mere fact that we can disagree is proof of \nmorality\u0027s subjective nature. If it isn\u0027t subjective, then whose morality \ndo we follow. Yours?","I agree with you. It is objectively true that there is a material \nfoundation to all of our behaviors, including our sense experience of right \nand wrong. It is objectively true that we have moral beliefs and that they \nare measurable.\n\nBut the beliefs themselves don\u0027t make testable predictions. Their truth \nvalues have no basis in reality. There is no objective moral truth.","+Henry Miller you act as though studies on the biology of behavior don\u0027t \nexist and aren\u0027t talked about in terms of positive or negative effects. For \nan organism, positive effects are things that increase the long term \nfitness of the organism and at a genetic level, things that increase the \nlong term survival of the species. For social animals, organisms are \ninterdependent and rely on cooperation as well as the punishment of \ncheaters. When people talk about morality, they\u0027re usually referring to \nbehaviors they think will benefit the health and longevity of the \nindividual and the species. Since you haven\u0027t killed yourself yet, I assume \nyou view life as worth preserving as well. You can get as bogged down in \npointless nihilistic babble as much as you want but at the end of the day, \nyou\u0027re constrained by the behaviors and preferences of a species that has \nevolved to value life and sociality.","+Henry Miller the harm being measured here is used to evaluate someone\u0027s \nperception of being raped. If they view it as good, their brains will \nrelease endorphins, etc. If they view it as bad, their bodies will release \nstress hormones, their ability to function will be impaired, etc. At the \nend of the study, you can say that rape is \nundesirable/unpleasant/disagreeable/bad to the person experiencing it. You \ncan say that rape being bad is just their perception of it but it is \nactually physically demonstrable that this perception is rooted in physical \nbiology.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nHarm is something that is measurable. Immorality is not. The statement \n\u0027causing harm is wrong\u0027 doesn\u0027t produce any testable predictions. That I \nknow of.","+Henry Miller you could do a test to see if people that were raped were \nwronged. It would be unethical but you could set it up like this:\n\nTreatment 1: individuals were forced to have sex after turning down a \nsuitor. You could do this at different intervals for as long as you \ndesired. Ideally at levels that mimicked treatment two.\n\nTreatment 2: individuals were allowed to have sex with a suitor under their \nown volition.\n\nPositive control: individuals were forced to have inter-species sex.\n\nIf rape is harmful to the individuals, it will show up as physical and \nemotional trauma. You could look at emotional trauma through brain scans, \nhormone levels, and observing behaviors around sex and other scenarios.","+Toah Ewok if you have to justify something, it implies there is a right \nand wrong. Acting in self-defense isn\u0027t murder if that\u0027s the justification \nyou\u0027re talking about. And there are rules about human behavior. Not all our \nbehaviors are in our self-interest. Some behaviors increase our inclusive \nfitness at the detriment to our direct fitness (typically only if the \nproduct of our relatedness and the benefit outweigh the cost) and some \naltruistic acts are reciprocal. Not all behavior is purely selfish.","+VIGILANTIA?\nThat\u0027s a really smart use of logic and I had to think about it for a while \nwhen +asdfers? pointed it out, but it\u0027s still not a scientific observation \nthat your making. Saying something doesn\u0027t exist doesn\u0027t mean it therefore \nexists because otherwise I woudn\u0027t be able to talk about it. That\u0027s like \nsaying proof of God\u0027s existence is that God is the greatest thing which can \nbe conceived, and so by conceiving of God\u0027s perfection, that proves he \nexists.","+Henry Miller \"There is no such thing as objective moral truth, but \neveryone, without exception, behaves as though their subjective moral \nbeliefs are objective.\"\n\n\nThere is no such thing as objective moral truth, except what you just \nstated as objective moral truth right? Tsk tsk tsk.","+asdfers??\nRight and wrong behaviors are those that someone says are right and wrong. \nThat\u0027s the measure. That\u0027s it. That, and nothing more. Even if everyone in \nthe world had the same moral beliefs, those beliefs still wouldn\u0027t be \nobjectively scientific. \u0027Survival is right\u0027 is a moral statement, and as is \nthe case of all statements, logic operations can be performed on it and \nconclusions produced. Our conversation is a fun example of that. But the \nstatement itself doesn\u0027t produce testable predictions. It doesn\u0027t predict \nthat warring tribes will survive, nor does it predict that they will go \nextinct. It just proclaims that survival is right and so we should do \nwhatever is required to survive. But you\u0027ve done something brilliant by \nchanging the definition of the word moral to instead mean \u0027concerned with \neffectiveness in survival\u0027 rather than \u0027concerned with the principles of \nright and wrong behavior\u0027, and by fleshing out a description of the \nconsequences of that belief, you were able to very cleverly make \"moral\" \nstatements that produce predictions and also be able to give support for \npopular moral beliefs since, by definition, the most popular moral beliefs \nare popular as a consequence of being best at surviving and so get passed \non the most. If anyone has even just a little bit of belief that morality \nis objective, your method of reinterpreting that word is, I think, a \nsurefire way to bring them over to your side of the argument. Impressive \nwork.\nI want to reaffirm that I\u0027m potentially open to change and to believing \nthat a moral statement can be objectively true, but it has to be done by \nproviding evidence that it produces a testable prediction rather than \nredefining the word moral.","+Henry Miller\n*Right and wrong behavior isn\u0027t synonymous with survival success and \nsurvival failure behavior.*\nSo what is it synonymous with?\nWhat other measure can you use? We\u0027re only talking now because we recognize \nthat us exchanging ideas is right because gaining knowledge is right \nbecause that leads to greater survival.\n\n*If the additional requirement of longterm survival through the generations \nwas also needed to be met, then historical examples of perpetual tribal \nwarfare could be called moral too.*\nAre there still many warring tribes though? Nope, they\u0027re all wiped out. \nThat model only worked until a superior model of cooperating tribes model \nevolved to replace it. Universal doesn\u0027t always imply  static.\n*For them, it might be preferable to what you might think is utopia.*\nSee above,  those folk are dead. The dead don\u0027t have a say.\n\n*I love the movie Starship Troopers but never knew it was a book.*\nDude, the book was fucking great. I defo recommend it. On thing to be aware \nof though, is that while the movies was satirical action shlock(is a good \nway of course) the book was completely earnest in its endorsement of a \nsociety where only that those that volunteer for active military service \ncan qualify as citizens. It does have mechs though. Everyone loves mechs.\n\"A suit isn\u0027t a space suit - although it can serve as one. It is not \nprimarily armor - although the Knights of the Round Table were not armored \nas well as we are...

So survival isn\u0027t synonymous with moral. I\u0027m \nusing the word moral in the typical way, but your use of the word is \ncertainly consistent with everything else you\u0027re saying. So I can\u0027t fault \nyou there.\n\nIf moral behavior merely needed to pass the test of being possible \nbehavior, everything people did could be called moral. If the additional \nrequirement of longterm survival through the generations was also needed to \nbe met, then historical examples of perpetual tribal warfare could be \ncalled moral too. I question your commitment to this version of morality. \nAfterall, warring tribes may very well like their violence and revel in its \ncarnage. For them, it might be preferable to what you might think is \nutopia. If you stick to your use of the word, then I\u0027ll just have to \nbelieve you that you mean what you say. So, given how you define morality, \nif it is the case that the societies which tend towards utopia are found to \ndo so because of the moral beliefs that they practice, and if other \nsocieties which employ those same morals tend towards utopia as well, and \nif societies which don\u0027t employ them tend towards dystopia, or maybe just \nstagnation, then you would be right to call those moral beliefs objective \ntruth because those types of moral statements produce repeatable, testable \npredictions. But since I don\u0027t define morality in that way, I myself \nwouldn\u0027t be able to call them objective truth.\n\nThanks for the link. I just read about Heinlein on Wikipedia. I\u0027m \nembarrassed to say that I\u0027ve never heard of him before. Or rather that I\u0027ve \nforgotten. I don\u0027t know why. I like Sci-fi. I love the movie Starship \nTroopers but never knew it was a book. I\u0027ve been wanting to read Stranger \nin a Strange Land for years now but didn\u0027t recognize the name Heinlein when \nI just now looked at his name on the book. I\u0027ve been wanting to read it and \nI know I looked up its author at some point in the past, but seeing his \nname now jogs no memories. At all.","+Toah Ewok\nAll murders are killings but not all killings are murder.  It is not a \nhuman right to murder, but it is a human right to use even lethal force \nwhen it comes to self defense.\n\n The wars that are justified are the ones that are defensive, and those \ncases the casualties they producecan be justified as a form of self \ndefense, ie, not as murder. Well, normally that is. When the allies \nfirebombed civilians @Dresden, or nuked civilians @Hiroshima that was \nobviously mass murder and an indefensible war crime.","+The Choler of Chloë But are they really universally wrong? Murder for \nexample, can be justified. Many times war results in many deaths, but it \ndoesn\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t go to war. While I put personally do not agree \nwith rape, murder or theft, I am simply staring that these are still \nsubjective opinions. And human nature is a bunch of bull, there are times \nwhen empathy can be discarded if it means we can benefit in some way. There \nare no magical rules for how we should act, if we ever show empathy then in \nthe end it for our own gains.","+Henry Miller\nYes morality is concerned with right and wrong behaviour. That\u0027s why \nsurvival is moral. Those that don\u0027t survive aren\u0027t capable of behaving in \nany way at all.\n\nThe instinct to survive is human nature itself, and every aspect of our \npersonalities derives from it. Anything that conflicts with the survival \ninstinct acts sooner or later to eliminate the individual and thereby fails \nto show up in future generations. . . . A scientifically verifiable theory \nof morals must be rooted in the individual\u0027s instinct to survive--and \nnowhere else!--and must correctly describe the hierarchy of survival, note \nthe motivations at each level, and resolve all conflicts.\nWe have such a theory now; we can solve any moral problem, on any level. \nSelf-interest, love of family, duty to country, responsibility toward the \nhuman race . . . .\nThe basis of all morality is duty, a concept with the same relation to \ngroup that self-interest has to individual.\nThat\u0027s the shorthand version that\u0027s given in Starship Troopers.\n\nFor a more comprehensive one, check out his full speech that Pragmatics of \nPatriotism. \nhttp://www.stolinsky.com/wordpress/index.php/2015/09/07/heinlein-on-patriotism/","+asdfers?\nThat first sentence should have read: It is objectively true that we have \nbeliefs,","+asdfers?\nI\u0027m not sure I understand what you mean by subatomic particles not being \ndirectly testable. Subatomic particles *are* studied and experimented with, \nafter all. Photos and electrons are fundamental particles and we observe \nthat stuff all the time. Maybe I\u0027m just reading too much into it and am \nmissing the point.","+asdfers?\nIt is objectively true that we have moral beliefs, but some of those \nbeliefs (like morality and free will) have no basis in physical reality. \nCulture C may die out because of their beliefs (a prediction which *is* \ntestable in precisely the scenario you laid out) but a belief that \nsomething is intrinsically right/good or wrong/bad doesn\u0027t produce any \ntestable outcomes. And I think you said as much and I might just be \nrepeating you.\nEffectiveness, competency or success is not the defining feature of moral \nstatements. The definition of moral is: concerned with the principles of \nright and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character. \nThe definition doesn\u0027t include survival success. But you are absolutely \ncorrect that popular moral beliefs come about and prevail because they \nsucceed in survival for the organisms that hold them.","+Henry Miller\nSecond hypothesis: It was a belief in murder that led to those murders \nhappening. Like subatomic particles the beliefs themselves aren\u0027t directly \ntestable but the effects they have on human behavior are.\n\nI\u0027ll link to it once I find but to understand where I\u0027m coming from go read \nthe Robert Heinlein\u0027s essay which posits morality is that which tends \ntowards survival. You can be moral and live, in which case you spread your \nmessage, or you can be immoral and die, in which you\u0027ll be too dead to say \nanything at all. To him, and to me it\u0027s akin to nutrition where the better \nmorality a culture practices the healthier it will be, and where continued \ntweaks and observations across many generations will eventually lead to a \nperfect utopia in which all are happy and prosperous.","+asdfers?\nThe statement that there is no such thing as objective moral truth is a \nstatement about the unscientific nature of moral statements because they do \nnot produce testable predictions. The statement that there is no such thing \nas objective moral truth itself being objective moral truth still doesn\u0027t \nproduce testable predictions about anything and is, itself, unscientific.\n\nCulture C will not die out because murder is immoral. Culture C will die \nout because murder.\n\nI\u0027ll be damned if that didn\u0027t take me a good number of minutes to think \nthrough. You\u0027re pretty good at this. I\u0027m not immovable. If you produce a \ncompelling enough argument, I just might change my view.","+Henry Miller \nCulture A believed that murder is acceptable.\nCulture B believed that murder should be prohibited.\nCulture A was wiped out within a generation.\nCulture B lived long an prospered.\nHypothesis: If culture C starts believing that murder is acceptable it will \nalso die out quickly because murder is immoral.","+Henry Miller \nThat there\u0027s no such thing as an objective moral truth is an objective \nmoral truth in itself.","+The Choler of Chloë?\nYou\u0027ve made the propositional statement that rape, murder and theft are \nuniversally wronging someone. That\u0027s a statement of fact about the world \nthat merely needs to be checked to see if it\u0027s a true fact. Except, there \nis no way to test it. You ask for an example of in instance where it isn\u0027t \nwrong, but what would constitute as a criteria needing to be met in order \nto falsify the claim? What would that even look like? Belief in objective \nmoral truth is unscientific.","+Petar Stamenkovic?\nI am making the very specific claim that moral statements do not produce \nrepeatable, testable predictions.\n\nThe statement that there is more to life than science implies that there \nare more ways than the scientific method with which we can look to come to \na correct understanding of our world and that they are just as good \n(correct me if I\u0027m wrong). However, the scientific method is the best tool \nthat we have for that.\n\nThe statement that science fails fairly often and that I am providing an \nexample of this implies that objective moral truth is a real thing and that \nscience, being unable to verify this claim, is proof of its failure. My \nstatement that the scientific method is the best tool we have to discover \ntruth is an assumed truth and is not open to debate. If you believe \ndifferently, then we don\u0027t have enough common ground on which to have a \nconversation. If objective moral truth were real, science should, in \nprinciple, be able to verify that. And no other philosophical method or \ntheory would be better equipped to do so.","+KurdzDotOrg?\nIf you have cherished beliefs that require you to hold as truth \nnon-testable statements, then yes, you would have to disregard them, \nscientifically speaking. Does your appreciation and advocacy of art require \nyou to believe the truth value of non-testable statements? I haven\u0027t made \nthe claim that things in general should be disregarded if they are treated \nin a subjective manner; I am making the claim that belief statements should \nbe disregarded if the scientific method cannot be applied to them. \n\nThere are scientists who adhere to empiricism and the scientific method in \ntheir line of work and who believe in God, and there are scientists who \ndon\u0027t. The mere fact that they are scientists doesn\u0027t make their theism *or* \natheism true. Likewise, professing adherence to empiricism and the \nscientific method, along with pointing out that you don\u0027t disregard all \nmorality simply because it\u0027s subjective, doesn\u0027t mean that your belief in \nobjective moral truth is right. That is an ignorant and illogical \napplication of the scientific method. And I haven\u0027t made the claim that \nthere is no objective moral truth on the grounds that morality is \nsubjective (although true, that statement is somewhat tautological). I am \ninstead making the specific claim that moral statements do not produce \ntestable predictions.\n\nDoes your belief that mass murder is wrong really, *actually* depend on a \nbelief in objective moral truth? Religious people are sometimes challenged \non their adherence to their religious texts to be the real source of their \nmoral beliefs. They are asked, \"Do you really believe it\u0027s wrong to kill \njust because a book told you so?\" If there were no holy books, people would \nstill believe it was wrong to murder and rape and steal. And if you didn\u0027t \nbelieve that there was objective moral truth, you\u0027d still believe these \nthings were wrong too, I assume. You don\u0027t need that kind of metaphysical \narchitecture to lay your beliefs on in order to have the feeling that \nmurder is wrong; you can just have the feeling.","+Toah Ewok rape, murder, and theft are all universally wronging someone. \nMaybe you can give me an example where someone forcefully initiates one of \nthese acts and someone isn\u0027t wronged as a result and that will help me \nunderstand why this is not a universal statement. Would you agree that a \nman raping a newborn baby is wrong? Or is that an arbitrary act?\n\n\nMe using the word psychopath wasnt meant to badmouth people that disagree \nwith me, I just use that to describe someone who generally lacks empathy \nand derives pleasure from the suffering of others. You disagree with me but \nId hesitate to call you a psychopath because I dont know whether you \nderive pleasure from sadistic acts. I could maybe safely refer to you as a \nnihilist? Do you like to rape people? What keeps you from raping people if \nsex is a pleasurable act for you? Is it empathy? Fear of the law? If you do \nenjoy rape, would you enjoy someone raping you? If your answer to the last \none is yes, I like to rape but no, I wouldnt like for someone to rape me \n(and again, it cant actually be rape if you enjoy it) can you see the \nhypocrisy in that statement? If someone can understand the hypocrisy, they \ncan understand empathy. And if you have empathy, that makes acts like rape, \nmurder, and theft wrong, even from the perpetrators perspective.\n\nWere chunks of organic matter with consciousness and the ability to \ncategorize and assign meaning to things. Id say thats a little different \nthan being some other organic matter like a glucose molecule, a puddle of \npetroleum, or a pile of bat guano. There are also some emergent properties \nthat are, due to evolution, part of human nature. One of these emergent \nproperties is the condemning anti-social behavior. This is why we refer to \npsychopaths as mentally ill. It is not a normal or sustainable behavior for \nhumans to totally disregard others preferences in favor of their own. It \nmay be in a serial killers immediate interest to kill the people in his \ncommunity but if he kills the people in the community he depends on or if \nother people adopt the same view as him, you can see how it will begin to \nwork against his own self-interest. We care about others lives and \npreferences because we need other humans to like us to survive (especially \nhistorically).\nAs far as me not giving empathy to everyone, you\u0027re right, I dont. If \nsomeone does not show me empathy, I will not provide it to them. That would \nbe self-destructive.","+Henry Miller Lucky for us that there is more to life than science than, am \ni right? ;)\n\nAs great as science is, it fails fairly often, as you shrewdly pointed out \njust now.","+Henry Miller In that same sense, we would have to disregard so much in the \nworld. Art often thrives in subjectivity, but we still appreciate and \nadvocate it.\n\nI am an radical empricist, and Science is key for me too, but that doesn\u0027t \nmean I disregard all morality simply because they are subjective. That is \nignorance, not logical. Go to any university you wish for, and you will \nfind that all the professors have some morality, including the ones in \nPhilosophy of Science. You take your Philosophy lessons too literally my \nfriend, your the Bible preacher pushing everyone away.","+The Choler of Chloë What makes it objective? The universe does not have \nmoral laws, there is no universal right or wrong. We\u0027re just chunks of \norganic matter in the end. Again, it\u0027s still subjective. Just because it \nfeels wrong to you doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s objectively wrong. And not \neveryone who disagrees with your opinions are mentally ill, devoid of \nempathy. They have empathy, but like you they do not grant it to everyone.","+Toah Ewok I guess the short answer to your reply is that the disagreement \ndoesnt matter. The perpetrator is objectively doing wrong unto someone \nelse. An immoral action doesnt need to be understood by a psychopath as \nsuch to have adverse consequences to the victim.","+Toah Ewok The raper, murderer, or thiefs lack of empathy (which is \nbiologically necessary for the development and maintenance of a highly \nsocial and interdependent society, like we have. Therefore, I would find it \nhard to argue that harming/doing wrong unto others is as simple as a whim \nor a preference since, to an extent, we are programmed to care about the \nthoughts and well-being of others.) doesnt matter. You cannot find a \nsituation where the victim thought the perpetrator was in the right and \nrarely will you find that the perpetrator, regardless of their attempt to \njustify their actions (which implies knowledge of the wrong they are \ninflicting), was totally ignorant of the lack of consent and/or the \nramifications their actions would have on the victim (e.g. You can rape \nsomeone out of lust and disregard for their autonomy but also be aware that \nwhat you are doing is fundamentally wrong, since it is personally harming \nthem and possibly their loved ones). Again, whether or not the perpetrator \nfinds it wrong though doesnt matter, since they are doing wrong unto \nsomeone else.","+HiBerg?\nBeliefs about morals, ethics and justice are subjective beliefs. The \nobservation that, over time, some people collectively agree on what those \nbeliefs are does not make them objectively true.","+David Patterson?\nI was making a statement about reality, not about the behavioral practice \nof humans making rules and handing out punishments. Your criticism is a non \nsequitur.","+KurdzDotOrg?\n+The Choler of Chloë?\n+Petar Stamenkovic?\nThe philosophy of the scientific method provides us with the only tool in \nthe universe which we can use to discover objective reality. Moral \nstatements do not produce repeatable, testable predictions. Belief in \nobjective moral truth is unscientific nonsense.","+The Choler of Chloë But the raper, murderer or thief could think that the \nperson does not get to choose. Or their needs outweigh the needs of others. \nOr that the victim is a terrible person in their eyes and deserves it \nanyway. Or maybe they just don\u0027t care. You could see their opinion as \nwrong, that\u0027s fine. However you can\u0027t really claim that any morality is \nobjective precisely because there is disagreement.","+Toah Ewok it\u0027s not subjective. The person you are \nraping/murdering/stealing from must find it wrong or it wouldn\u0027t be \nconsidered raping, murdering, or stealing. So, it\u0027s a fact that you are \ndoing wrong unto them anytime one of those situations occur.","+The Choler of Chloë It\u0027s still subjective. Just because you think it\u0027s \nwrong and have reasons for thinking so doesn\u0027t make it objective morality.","There are objective moral truths. For example, rape, murder, and theft are \nimmoral acts. You can\u0027t rape someone that is consenting, murder someone who \nvalues their life, or steal something from someone who wants to give it \naway. By their very definition, these acts are wrongful.","+Henry Miller As soon as you subjectify morality, anything becomes \nacceptable. One can take the position of saying \u0027mass murder is acceptable, \nas there is no universal truths\u0027. Universal morals certainly isn\u0027t \ncontingent, but that does not mean it is meaningless. We assume matters \nsuch as equality, freedom and justice because they have a universal \nmeaning, and are applicable to all humans and in the future (hopefully) \nanimals. Just because equality is not intrinsic or an element in the \nperiodic table that doesn\u0027t necessarily make them subjective in the sense \nthat we woudn\u0027t adopt them.","That\u0027s a pointless train of thought. We decide together what our enforced \nmorals are and people have to follow that or get punished. Debating the \nsubjectivity/objectivity does nothing for us.","+Henry Miller I disagree. There are objective truths, even moral ones.","+Henry Miller Moral, ethics and justice is in constant change. They are \ndefined by human culture and will therefor by the nature of culture change \nover time.","+SuperAabbcc123456 ELABORATE!!!!!!!..........","You seem to be removing the Palestinians from responsibility here","+Mythic Dawn okay...

What\u0027s important? \n\n1. Russian history scientists made a complex understanding of Russian State \ndevelopment. There are LOTS of texts that could be used as sources on early \nRussian history, but every single one is controversial. Nestor\u0027s one was \nchosen as a consensus between opposing history theories, but it was never \nthe only nor the very truthful one. \n\n2. Kievan Rus\u0027 was never a term used by Medieval Russians. It is a term \ninvented by Russian Empire historians in the late 1700s to describe a \nperiod in Russian History. It\u0027s just like term \u0027Byzantium\u0027 was introduced \nto describe Eastern Roman Empire history, while the residents of it called \nthemselves Romans. \n\n3. Inviting a foreign ruler was a common thing among classical Dark Ages \nnations. Invited leader wasn\u0027t a despot or a king, but a konung, \u0027knyaz\u0027, a \nspecialist in state running and large scale warfare. \n\n4. Early Russian expanse was made through series of conquests. Russians \nconquered Constantinople at least twice before adopting Christianity, which \nwas a war trophy (among the rest - from money contribution to the Byzantium \nEmperor daughter). \n\n5. Russians fought off numerous invasions from the East, and the mongol \nones were the toughest. It was Russians who have destroyed the last \nremnants of the united mongol empire in the battles of Kulikovo and the \nUgra, saving all of the Europe from the horrors of it. \n\n6. Most of the Russian land acquisition relates to 1600s+ and the Romanov \ndynasty kings and queens. And it was Peter the Great who actually declared \nRussia an Empire (also, Romanov). \n\n7. Most of the differences between Russians and neighbouring nations come \nfrom religion differences and political alliances since the Middle Ages. \n\nFor example, it was Poles to invade Russia in it\u0027s Civil War (1584-1613) to \nget a cut in the largest pie in the world, and it was Christian Crusaders \n(mostly Lithuanians and Teutons) to launch Holy Crusades against Russia in \nXI-XIII centuries. It\u0027s hard to expect good relationships with the nations \nthat put a knife to your back when you turn a blind eye there, right?.. \n\nIt\u0027s more like Russia is always on the defence, but it rarely fights back \nwith military power for a number of reasons.\n\nSo, basically this video is inaccurate and misleading, while I admit the \ntime and resources put into the thing are amazing.

However most of their land after expanding beyond Muscovy \nwasn\u0027t \"eastern rus territories\" but were the result of colonial conquests \nof siberian natives, since they were able to expand unchecked until they \nreached a firearm bearing china.

When the \nOrthodox Christianity was brought to Kievan Rus in the 10-th century it was \ndone in the medium of what is nowadays called Church-Slavic language which \nis essentially and old form of Bulgarian.

Could have done better then \njust retelling old tales and looked at actual historic research!\n1) Rurik actually existed- but didn\u0027t have any brothers, the story of 3 \nbrothers coming to rule Novgorod stems from misunderstanding of the phrase \n\u0027Rurik sineh us truvor\u0027 which meant \u0027 Rurik with his soldiers\u0027 (no wonder \nthe two extra brothers are only mentioned once). Also, his story of coming \nto power is more interesting then an invitation- Rurik was a captain of \nmercenaries hired by a rich city of Novgorod, who eventually accumulated \nenough power to proclaim himself a prince. Interestingly, they were never \nregarded as conquerors, and integrated nicely into the new nation. At least \nthat\u0027s what today\u0027s researchers claim.\n\n2) The legend of prince Vladimir choosing Orthodox Christianity over other \nreligions is also just a legend. He didn\u0027t really have a choice: Catholic \nchurch, Judaism and Islam could by no means compete with Orthodox \nChristianity in the region dominated by Byzanthium. Kiev already had a \nlarge Greek orthodox diaspora, and Vladimir\u0027s own grandmother, Princess \nOlga, was Orthodox Christian (baptised at an adult age). \n\n3) The Mongols were, by far, not the first horde coming from the \nsouth-east. There were many before them, and Russians had no problem \nresisting them, since they were much weaker than the Mongols, and this is \nexactly the reason why they didn\u0027t take these new nomads seriously. \n\n4) Why not mention the heavy influence the nomadic tribes had over Russia? \nThey were neighbours first, and imperial subjects later! Why not tell about \nthe wars with Mongols over the Volga river territories, and of Siberia \nlater, at least??","Do you know that Vladimir(who made slavs christians) killed one third of \nlocal people because they did not want to change religion.?","Actually a retarded mongolian fucked a polish pig and thus the first \nrussian was born?","Published 6 days ago, so the map is not proper, I\u0027m afraid - should include \nCrimea.?","Well the first 60% is recited bs.

Russians chose Christianity for a reason that has nothing to do with \nalcohol, Holy Land or similar crap.

In catholic \nworld the Pope is superior to the kings, in islamic world religion can even \ngovern your legal system and judaism was only used by Hebrews and Khazars \nmaking it too unpopular and distant to Russians.\n2.

First \nof all, how do you define freedom? Next, you think that but truth is a lot \nmore complex.\n\nRussia \u003d Tyranny?\nYou judge Russia simply using 40 years of its history when the Bolsheviks \nJews also were destroying Russia\u0027s culture and heritage (which Putin is \nreturning)? Russia\u0027s history spans centuries. A century isn\u0027t enough to \nmake a fair judgement of the country.

Admirable. Not many nations left are \nwilling to challenge the NWO. Russia is one of the few. If only my country \ncould too.\n\nRussia means tyranny now? \nEven if Russia is tyrannical in nature, it can exercise its tyranny as a \ngreater force has taken over: The USA\n\nSo you are telling me that Russia is always the bully? Well, that is a very \nbigoted view. Let us admit it: all countries are bullies at times, and are \nvictims at other times.\n\nI do love freedom, but again, Russia doesn\u0027t mean tyranny and I do believe \nRussia can adjust after Putin destroys the Communists and fascist \nopposition. \n\nI love my country\n\nSincerely,\nA patriotic British nationalist","+Sir George Severn \"Vladimir Putin is the best President on Earth\" and in \nnext comment \"I won\u0027t talk about Putin.\" You started.\nYou will not write \u0027Shortly live America\u0027 but would you write \"Shortly live \nNazi Germany\u0027 or \"Death to N.

Always, with no exceptions \nin history. So it was throughout the 20th century (Poland, East Germany, \nCzechoslovakia) , so it is now (Ukraine, Belarus, Chechnya, etc.). Yes, \nyou\u0027re right, I was imprecisely writing \"Shortly live Russia\", that - I \nmean of course, present Russia as a state, not the people. I know many \nRussians, I like most of them, what I don\u0027t like is their love for \ndictators. It\u0027s very sad. They want to be World Power so much, even at the \ncost of their freedom, freedom of speech.\n\nSadly, knowing the history however, it is clear that under every power, \nPutin or not, Russia is a dangerous global bully, not a leader.\n\nRussia is a beautiful country, but you would not want to live in it, \nespecially if you know what it means to life in a free country and you \nvalue the freedom of speech (you should, you have Darwin in your avatar \npicture).","+gregowski\nYou look like a complete fool.

The \ndecision in favor of Cyrillic created an alphabetical difference between \nthe two literary centres of the Bulgarian state in Pliska and Ohrid. In the \nwestern part the Glagolitic alphabet remained dominant at first. However, \nsubsequently in the next two centuries, Glagolitic gradually ceased to be \nused there at all.[11] Nevertheless, particular passages or words written \nwith the Glagolitic alphabet appeared in Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts \ntill the end of the 14th century.[12]\n\nOnly in Croatia the Glagolitic alphabet was used until the 19th century. \nNowadays, Glagolitic is used only for Church Slavic (Croatian .

Among our friends only one couple thought \nthat this is invasion and unfair. Now they both live in Moscow working at \ngiant IT company. I think to understand all this Ukraine-war-Crimea-Russia \nproblem one should learn some history of these regions, about Catherine the \nGreat, Russian Empire period in Crimea, Black Sea Fleet, WWII, Soviet \nperiod in Crimea, how Crimea became the part of Ukraine, how Crimean voted \nin 1991 when Ukraine carried out the referendum about independence from \nUSSR, about Ukrainian revolutions and how Crimean people thought about it \nand so on. \nStart with this wikipedia article about Crimean ethnicies.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Crimea \nSpoilers : (according to 2001 year) Russians:1.18 million \n(58.3%), Ukrainians: 492,200 (24.3%), Crimean Tatars: 243,400 (12.0%)","+pantagruel People like you are worse then fucking cancer and aids combined.","+IShallUseFire! \"Russia ain\u0027t all that bad\" - neither is cancer.","+Matt Schwartz just like Turkey, Usa, the arabs, iran, most european \ncountries as well as asian and african.

He is clever man and quite a strong \npersonality, but there are some problems with his world outlook and the \nenvironment in which he works. Why he can\u0027t fight against corruption? \nBecause many top officials in the government and heads of major state-owned \ncompanies and contractors are his friends. On the one hand he can\u0027t fight \ncorruption because of personal ties, on the other hand, all this corrupted \nstate machine, if necessary, could sweep him away. So maybe he didn\u0027t have \nenough courage. As for freedom of the media. He thinks that as soon as the \nstate will lose control of the media, there will begin massive \nanti-government propaganda, he is afraid that the media may be purchased by \nhis political opponents or \"traitors\". Remember the story about the \nsubmarine \"Kursk\" disaster? When some channel broadcasedt an interview with \nthe wives of the dead sailors, who accused the president of inaction, he \ncalled the director of the channel, and said that they had hired whores to \naccuse him. Anyway, he dealed with some problems of the country, but to \nsolve the remaining problems we need a new, fresh look. And yes, our media \nhave a tough game with human feelings and I do not think that\u0027s happening \nwithout his knowledge. Now, foreign policy, and Ukraine. He got into the \ngame imposed by the West, trying to get out of it with the maximum benefit. \nI hate Putin, Obama, EU and Ukranian leaders for unleashing war between the \nbrotherly peoples of Russia and Ukraine. for me and many other Russian, \nit\u0027s something like a civil war. It\u0027s difficult for foreigners to imagine \nthe closeness of our (ru and ua) peoples and the pain that we feel because \nof all this weird situation. The problem is that Putin acts correctly in \nterms of policy and strategy. We got a hostile government in the most \nintimate and important country for us, it appeared there not only because \nof the policies of the West, but also because of the Ukrainian domestic \nissues (the struggle of parties, some dirty politicians attempt to use \nanti-russian rhetoric, the opposition flirting with neo-nazis). Putin \ndecided to take the Russian Crimea, playing on people\u0027s feelings, to secure \nRussian military base and raising his popularity, Putin decided to create a \nfrozen conflict, to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and the EU (not sure \nabout eu). Was it worth 10 000 human lives? I think no. And something more, \nPutin wants Russia to have a free trade zone with EU and visa-free regime, \nbutso that Russia and other former soviet countries have done this \ntogether, as our economies are interlinked and if any one country suddenly \njoins the EU, it will break the harmonious economic relations.

These conditions preclude \nthe solution given in the video, by which the first man uses the word \n\u0027black\u0027 or \u0027white\u0027 to \"signal\" an odd number of hats of that color to the \nother people who would give their answers after him, based on that signal. \nThat is most definitely conveying information and is most definitely a \n\"signal.\" Furthermore, all the other people are able to deduce from this \n\"signaled\" information, combined with the inadvertently conveyed \ninformation of the color given by the subsequent persons, their own hat \ncolor. These are most definitely NOT \"guesses.\" They are logical deductions \nwith 100% accuracy rate, assuming no human error on the part of the \nprevious persons in line. So, techincally the given solution fails those \ntwo criteria. It involves a signal, and does not involve any guesses.\nBut to be fair, those rules especially the one insisting on \"guesses\" \npreclude any possible solution, since any solution which guaranteed success \ncould not be guessing. If, therefore, we choose to interpret the rules more \nleniently to allow the solution given in the video, i.e., to not prohibit \nthat sort of signal given and to allow non-guess answers, then two other \nsolutions offered in comments below work just as well.\nOne is the time delay solution mentioned by at least 2 people. And the \nother is the rather humorous solution of taking off your hat and looking at \nit.\nThe only rules violated by the time delay solution are exactly the rules of \nsignaling and guessing, the same two rules violated and to the exact same \ndegree, and in almost the exact same way, by the given binary-code \nsolution. So those two solutions are exactly equally valid.\nAs for the looking-at-your-hat solution (lol), this is, in fact, \ntechnically the best solution. Why? Because it violates the fewest of the \ngiven rules. Like the other two solutions, it violates the \"guessing\" rule, \nsine you are not \"guessing\" the color of your hat if you looked at it. But \nunlike the other two solutions, it does not also violate the \"signal\" rule, \nsince it sends no signal.\nSince this solution violates only ONE rule and the other two solutions each \nviolate TWO rules, this looking-at-your-hat solution, ironically, is \ntechnically the best of the three.\nAnd I have to say, that just makes me happy.?","My solution would be to agree that the person in the back says black if the \ncolor of the person two people in front of him matches the hat of the \nperson in front of him. White if they don\u0027t match (or vise versa). This \nwould continue until you get to the serving person in the front.

Took me longer to get, but here it is...\n\nRealize that black or white is a binary choice, meaning we can represent \nthe line up as a binary digit. Let black be 1, and white be 0.\n\nSimplify the problem into a 3-person scenario.\n\nTherefore, the binary digit for this line up ranges from 000 to 111 (or 0 \nto 7 in decimal).\n\nAssume everyone is wearing black hats. Therefore, the answer is 111 (7 in \ndecimal).\n\nFrom the perspective of the first player, they see two blacks. Then, the \nnumber in this case is either 011 or 111 (either 3 or 7).\n\nMagically assume that the first person in line gets the color of their hat \nright.\n\nFrom the perspective of the second player, they know the color behind them \nis black, and in front is black. So they know the number is 101 or 111 (5 \nor 7 in decimal).\n\nMagically assume that the second person in line gets the color of their hat \nright.\n\nFrom the perspective of the third player, they know the color of the two \nhats behind them are black. So the number is either 110 or 111 (6 or 7 in \ndecimal).\n\nNow, assuming that the first person guesses their hat correctly, notice how \nevery person in the line will all think of two different numbers -- either \nthe right one, or the wrong one. They will all think of different wrong \nnumbers, and all will think of the same right number.\n\nNotice also that the right number is always higher (in this case) than the \nwrong number.\n\nThe key is therefore:\n1) To remove the first person from the number (so the 3-digit number \nbecomes a 2-digit number), and\n2) To have the first person be able to hint \"higher\" or \"lower\" for all the \nrest of the players of the line to correctly figure out what the number is. \nSay black is higher, white is lower.\n\nLet\u0027s test this idea:\n\nTake the case of all white hats. Three people in line. Assume everyone is \nintelligent.\n\nFirst person sees two white hats. Then the number is 00 (0 in decimal).\n\nFirst person knows the second person will see 1 white hat, and so will \nthink the answer is either 10 or 00 (2 or 0 in decimal).\n\nFirst person knows the third person will hear \"white\" behind them (if the \nsecond person correctly calculated) and so will think the answer is either \n01 or 00 (1 or 0 in decimal).\n\nFirst person knows that among the possible answers everybody can think of, \nthe lower answer is correct.\n\nFirst person says \"white\"\n\nSecond person knows to choose the lower number from whatever they are \nthinking -- either 0 or 2. They know the number is 0, or 00 in binary. They \ncalculate their hat is white.\n\nThird person knows to choose the lower number from whatever they are \nthinking -- either 0 or 1. The know the number is 0, or 00 in binary. They \ncalculate their hat is white.\n\nSound good?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: The above breaks down for 101 or 110. :(?","Please make more of these videos even tho I never got any of the answers \nright so far I like a challenge which makes me smarter and training my \nbrain ?","Wouldn\u0027t work if there are 0 black hats in front of the tallest person.. \nRight??","Wouldn\u0027t work if there are 0 black hats in front of the tallest person.. \nRight??","1.)

Technically, and to and equal degree, they \nare both sending a signal, so if the aliens allow one, we must assume they \nwould allow the other. \nAs for taking the hat off and looking at it, lolz... what else can you say \nabout that? Thinking outside the box. Well.. actually there is a slight \nproblem with wording. The video says \"each of you must GUESS the color of \nyour hat.\" I suppose you could look at it, see that it\u0027s black, give the \naliens a cheeky grin and say, \"whelp, I guess it\u0027s black.\" :D ...and hope \nthey have enough sense of humor not to eat you. But they might decide it \ndoesn\u0027t qualify as a \"guess\" if you look first.","+Emmanuel Bourmault There was NO point in the video that said that they \ncouldn\u0027t take their hat off.","+Nobody Cares  No, that was forbidden.","+Emmanuel Bourmault Just take off your hat and look at it.","+Emmanuel Bourmault that was similar to my first idea, but realized that \nwould be \"signaling\"","+Chris Thompson I mean the solution is also signaling to the other people \ninformation.

It sounds far fetched from my 1-sentence description, \nwhich is why they wrote a whole book about it. It\u0027s a pretty main-stream \ntheory. Anyway, if that is the case, then the universe is full of inert \nbacteria in stasis, and there is life literally in every place that can \npossibly sustain life, and all of it is DNA based, made out of carbon, \nwater, and amino-acids just like us. It may be wrong; it\u0027s a theory. But it \nis evidence-based. Anyway, it\u0027s an interesting thought.","+Utony Nguyen Now that is an excellent point I did not think about","+TC Coltharp I think a logical reason an alien civilisation might not wanna \neat Earthlings is that we are just not nutritious to them. By nutritious, I \nmean the prey/food needs to provide stuff for the eaters to build/function \ntheir own bodies. Most aliens would not have evolved on Earth and so most \nlikely would not be composed of the fundamental 20 something animo acids \nbuilding blocks used by life here, and most likely they might require \nelements particular to their home planet which we cannot provide. We have \nnothing to give except for possibly the taste. Even then, an alien body \nwould most likely don\u0027t know how to deal with human flesh and the results \nwouldn\u0027t be enjoyable. Everything around us are Earth-native and are \nfundamentally the same in composition going deep enough, yet if we eat \nsomething too foreign, we might have to make a run for the washroom.

Instead, if they were to say WHY it \nwouldn\u0027t work, then it would be more helpful.\n\n\nFor example: \"it\u0027s not gonna work because I can\u0027t count\" or \"it\u0027s not gonna \nwork because im blind\"\nBut then again, if the blind person is the shortest, then it would still \nwork.","+Nieve Andrea Humans are omnivores. There are several proteins that we need \nto survive that only come from animals or very particular plants.

It is why vegans have to watch their diets so closely or the \nend up malnourished in just a few months, but slobs can haphazardly can \nlive off animal based foods and junk food for decades when they are young.\n\n\nModern humans can live off plants alone (and actually be healthier in the \nattempt), but is delicate arrangement made possible only be modern farming, \nglobalization, and refrigeration. But the idea that we are frugivores \nfaking being carnivores is hippy crap. After eating meat for a few million \nyears, a species is no longer faking it.","+TC Coltharp Humans are just frugivores wanting to be carnivores, but \nthey\u0027re not. This carnivore-worship comes from their fear of wolves, lions \nand other big carnivores since humans used to be their prey. That\u0027s all \nthere is to it. Humans need to go back to eat fruits and nuts and \nvegetables, and realise that any carnivore, once they evolve, will become a \nherbivore. It\u0027s just the order of things. Compassion rules, man!","+Nieve Andrea The thing is that any advanced civilization is likely to \narise from the omnivores or carnivores of a planet.  \n\n\nIf you look at any food chain, typically the higher you climb in it the \nsmarter the life form becomes. This is because it takes far more \nintelligence to find, stalk, and kill another animal, than smell where the \ngrass is and eat in vicinity of the smell. Plus since it is so calorie \ndense, meat allows the species more free time to pursue other activities. \nAn intelligent herbivore is still going to have spend all day grazing in \norder to fuel its over sized brain. It is hard to compose Mozart, discover \nCalculus, or paint the Last Supper if you need to spend 10 hours a day \neating forage and your cud.\n\n\nGiven those facts, it might not be so outlandish to discover that most \nspace faring races are entirely carnivores.

If the hat in front \nof him is white, he can say either black or white with different pitches. \nLet\u0027s say his hat was black and the one in front of him is white, he can \nsay white normally and get his wrong.

Failing the test doesn\u0027t guarantee none \nof those 10 people to be logical and cooperative, it only shows that at \nleast one of them are not.\n2) if there is only one smart person in the group, then the puzzle makes it \nher responsibility to make sure all of the others understand the strategy, \nwhich sounds \"acceptable\" in this puzzle. But in the horse situation, it \nwould sound crazy to ask one smart horse to train another less intelligent \nhorse to do certain tasks, where if the other horse fails, the smart horse \ndies as well.\n\nHowever, there might be a plot twist in what those aliens actually want:\nObviously those aliens know that winning the test doesn\u0027t ensure true \nintelligence in those human beings, and losing the test doesn\u0027t ensure true \nlack of intelligence in each and every one of those human beings. So maybe \nthe \"true test\" is to see whether those humans realize this bs test is \nactually bs by pointing out its flaws.\nIf none of those human beings can point out the bs test\u0027s flaws, then this \nensures that none of those human beings are logical.","+ocnarf chan why would the aliens need to have the humans understand? it \nonly further proves that humans are illogical beings that can be eaten. if \nthere was an exceptional human, then if she can prove it, she may be able \nto convince the aliens to make a case study of her. but looking at our \nscientific history, just because there\u0027s were exceptional horses did not \nmake the treatment of the rest of the horses any better, etc., and no \nscientists who couldn\u0027t train the animals to act the way they wanted them \nto were treated as animals themselves. \n\naliens may be a different species with perhaps advanced civilization, but I \ncan\u0027t imagine it going much differently. the only thing that might go \ndifferent is that the one exceptional human may have an easier time proving \nthat she is a special case than the exceptional animals have proving that \nthey are special to us.","+ocnarf chan Yeah, you are right, but this should be obvious because \notherwise, no one could make any conclusions.","Yep","+nadjim73 what about the condition of \"there are exactly 2 black hats and 2 \nwhite hats\"?

What would happen if some \nother guy did the same thing and he just so happened to picked 10 highly \nintelligent cows, then his test would say that cows are highly intelligent. \nWho\u0027s test would the law regard as the one that shows the actual \nintelligence of cows?","+ocnarf chan let\u0027s put it this way; let\u0027s say I\u0027ve never seen cows before. \nI want to know if it would be moral to eat cows. putting aside the argument \nof animal rights and vegetarianism, I just want to know they aren\u0027t \nlogical, rational beings like myself. so I give the cows this hat test, \nasking them to tap their front hoof for black, back hoof for white.\n\nif half the cows get their hats right, I\u0027m not going to think those cows \nare smart and can\u0027t be eaten and the rest are stupid and can be eaten.

Or do you \nmean if there is one illogical or uncooperative human being, then aliens \ncan eat us all?","+ocnarf chan the alien law, as far as I can tell, is about X as a species, \nnot X as an individual. if only one person gets the answer right, then \nhumans as a whole are a rational race that can cooperate and think \nlogically. If not, then the humans as a whole are irrational beings who \nonly got the answers correctly by blind luck and therefore can be cattle.","All what you said above I think is right, but I feel like our conversation \nshifted from it\u0027s original subject.

The number of scenarios in which at least 4 out of 5 are right. Well \nobviously that is the sum ob the number of scenarios in which all of them \nare right and the number of scenarios in which exactly 4 out of 5 are \nright. It couldn\u0027t be more obvious than that.\n2. The number of all possible scenarios.\n\nThe second one is easy it is just 2*2*2*2*2 because for each one we have 2 \npossibilities. Now for the first one we need to find these 2 numbers. Let\u0027s \nstart with the number of scenarios in which all are right. Well, that is 1 \nbecause there is only one way for that to happen. Now the trickier one is \nexactly 4 out of 5. Figuring this out is a combination of 2 thing. Now \nlet\u0027s consider this what is the number of ways in which the first 4 would \nget it right and the fifth one won\u0027t - 1. Because there is only one option \nfor each of them. And the second one, what is the number of ways we can \narrange these 5 people - the 4 right ones are identical to each other so \nthe question is in how many different positions can we put the one that is \nwrong - 5. First, second, third, fourth and fifth. So we have 5 ways of \narranging them and for each of those 5 ways we have 1 way of them getting 4 \nout of 5 right where the wrong one is a particular one and not just any of \nthem. We multiply 5 by 1 and we get 5. So finally we add 5 with 1 (the \nnumber of scenarios in which all are right) and we get 6. So we have 6 \nscenarios in which at least 4 out of 5 are right. And finally as I said in \nthe beginning we divide that by the number of all possible scenarios and we \nget: 6/(2*2*2*2*2)\u003d3/(2*2*2*2)\u003d18.75%\nIs it hard? No it isn\u0027t.","+herogoose I normally restrain myself from doing this, but, God, you are \nstupid! Your question makes no fucking sense. It is like asking how you \ncame up with the result of 13+26. How did you get 39? You cold have just \nsaid 0. You could have just added 6+3. You could have just added 1+2. How \ndid you know to multiply 3 by 10 and add it to 9 to get 39? Are you fucking \nretarded. I already explained how such problems are solved. You are just \nplain stupid. What does it mean that \"his way is easier since its more \nsimplistic and straight forward \"? It \"is easier since its more simplistic \nand straight forward\" to answer every math problem with 0. You wouldn\u0027t do \nthat though, would you? Your whole argument is based on 2 things:\n\n1. I\u0027m stupid and I don\u0027t understand the thing you explained, therefore I \nassume that anyone who is smarter than me must be a bad person in some way, \nwho has memorised a lot of stuff without understanding them and is actually \nnot smarter than me, but is just a nerd.\n2.

Whatever I will leave it as an \nexplanation.\n\nYour suggestion is to have the first 5 people tell the next five people \ntheir colours. So, we have 5 people who will guess 100% and 5 which will \nnot. Each one has 50% chance of guessing right. Out of these 5 people at \nleast 4 must guess right. The probability of each of them guessing right \nis 50%*50%*50%*50%*50%\u003d1/(2*2*2*2*2). The probability of only 4 of them \nguessing right is 5/(2*2*2*2*2). If we add these 2 together we get \n6/(2*2*2*2*2)\u003d3/(2*2*2*2)\u003d18.75%. Please, tell me how you got 75%, even if \nyou understood what I said.","Only 1 incorrect answer dude.

The probability is 3/(2*2*2*2)\u003d18.75% and not \n75%. I have no idea how you got that answer.","+AmazingGryphon Facebook should add a learn button","+Nathan Crew To learn...","+Faith No More No, I did not know the answer nor the \"logic\" (whatever that \nmeans). I just paused the video and my thought process was that since we \nneed 9 out of 10, we need to choose which one to \"loose\". Then we notice \nthat the first guy has no information about his hat, therefore he is the \none that we \"loose\" and he should give some information to the rest so that \nthey can get it right. We start with the second guy, the first guy can tell \nhim his colour and he will guess right, but then the rest have no \ninformation. He can tell him if his hat is the same with the third one\u0027s \nhat and then they will both get it right. BTW, forgot to say that we are \nlooking for yes/no, 0/1, white/black information. So after we see the \nsolution for the third and the second we see that it utilises common \ninformation (the colour of the third one\u0027s hat, which is known both by the \nfirst and the second person), so what common information do the first and \nthe second have? The colours of the hats of the rest of the people. And \nthen it becomes obvious that we can use the parity of the black/white hats \n(because we need 0/1 information, that is the only thing that depends on \neach hat (no lost of information)). And we easily see that when the second \none says his colour the rest can subtract that, then the third, the fourth, \nand so on. And there it is - the solution. Okey, maybe 1-2 minutes is a bit \nshort for some people, but if you are going to get it, it won\u0027t be more \nthan 5 minutes (of actual thinking that is, not staring at the ceiling).

If the scale stays even..it means the heavier \ncoin is in the other group....if not,we stick to the heavier group..either \nway,we now split the group that we know it has the heavier coin in \nindividual coins and we put them on the scale ... and find the heavier coin \n:3 ","+Uber Megustador  You\u0027re not stupid. This is one of the hardest problems \nI\u0027ve ever tackled and I thought I was a genius for solving it. Can you \nanswer: You have a balance scale and 12 identical coins.

I\u0027ll try clarifying: This video was \nsponsored by Always, for their campaign #LikeAGirl (as seen at the end of \nthe video). That\u0027s why the animation focused on young girl confidence; \nthat\u0027s the campaign\u0027s target.\n\nFor more context, here\u0027s what happened in a video for the campaign: Some \nvery young (10yo and below), and some older (16yo and above) girls were \nasked to mimic various actions \"like a girl\" (run like a girl, fight like a \ngirl, ...). The young girls would mimic passion, whereas the older ones \nwould mimic clumsiness, ridiculousness.\nThat\u0027s what the campaign fights: \"like a girl\" has become synonym of \n\"badly\" for many people. The source of such a problem is not easy to \npinpoint, of course. However, if \"like a girl\" becomes bad, then it implies \nempowering \"like a boy\" (in a simplified fashion).\n\nBack to the video: The script is obviously general, and it has several \ncomplicated terms - \"Social pressure\" being one of them. Considering that \nrepresenting \"social pressure\" on a person is not easy, and that the \ncampaigns fights the bad nature of \"like a girl\", the choice of male \npressure on the girl, seems like a justified choice. It\u0027s *a* way to \nrepresent social pressure relatively clearly, and fitting the #LikeAGirl \ncampaign.\n\nIf the problem is lack of male representation, then find the person at 3:29, \nwho I guess is a male. His role is to advice the girl who failed, which \nmakes him a \"good\" person. Also, I couldn\u0027t find a distinctive sign that \nall the other persons are girls.?","Where can i dislike a whole comment section again??","i dont think this is gonna be enough for me, today i have to go to a dinner \nparty of a family menber, they are all very high class and everytime they \nsee me all they do is talk about my weight, im overweight and honestly i \nfell fine being that way, i feel miserable doing exercise and diets and \nhave a tiroid problem so of course im gonna have much more weight, and im \nok with that.

It\u0027s of absolutely no consequence if this was for this \n\"LikeAGirl\" campaign. The fact this campaign is even a thing is just \ndiscriminatory enough on it\u0027s own. If you\u0027re going to set up a campaign to \nhelp people with a problem, you help *all* people with that problem. If \nbreast cancer campaigns only actually seeked to help women affected by it, \nand not the thousands of men that are as well, that\u0027d be discrimination. \nThere\u0027s no reason the same shouldn\u0027t apply to any other kind of mental, or \nphysical health problem, *including* self confidence.\n\n\nAnd for another, you can say this video is aimed at women, but here\u0027s the \nproblem with that. This video gives no indication, from the title, or the \nthumbnail that this is for women only, so there are plenty of guys that \nclicked on this, hoping to get some help with their own self-worth issues, \nand while the audio might be applicable, they will be greeted with a video \nin which the only representation they get is as a bunch of symbols \nattacking the, for lack of a better word, protagonist of the video. Those \npeople came here to feel better about themselves, but what they got was a \nvideo that makes out that only women are the victims of this problem, and \nonly men are the perpetrators. That doesn\u0027t help them, that makes their \nproblem worse.\n\n\nNow maybe this kind of targeted help works better than an all-inclusive \ncampaign, but when it comes at the cost of making people outside your \nselected audience feel worse about themselves, it\u0027s not fucking worth it. \nYou can\u0027t go helping one group of people, to the detriment of all others, \nand try to justify it.","And even if you are a male, it doesn\u0027t stop you from using the tips given \nin the video.

Those people will go farther at \ntreating any cancer at all, compared to the more generalized groups that \naim to just vaguely target cancer. Vague methods lead to vague results. The \nstricter the method, the more confined the results sure, but the farther \nyou will go within that specific sub-path of that overarching goal.\n\nIt\u0027s a pro VS con thing. And it\u0027s important to remember that there is \nalways other people in the world, who can focus on other aspects of the \nproblems.","+Vincent Freel \nIt is a form of \"descrimination\". But in the same sense that when I choose \nbetween chocolate and vanilla icecream. While there are more universal and \nbalanced methods that target larger amounts of people. Such solutions are \nmuch more limited in scope and it just begs the question... why not have \nthe best of ALL worlds?\n\nYou can\u0027t just save the entire world at the same time. You can only play a \nsmall part.\n\nI mean if we follow your logic, targeting sexism is descriminating AGAINST \nracism. But perhaps a person just more personally relates to sexism as an \nissue, compared to racism, as well have much more to contribute to sexism \nthan racism.","+Willie Wonker \"Keep dick riding that 1:00 part, huh.\"  Wow, that\u0027s pretty \nhomophobic.","+Sky Alderson Idk if I\u0027d call myself a feminist, but I can say I do believe \nwomen and men should be equally respected in every way.\nThat being said, the imagery @ 1:00 was by no means unnecessary imo.

Who takes almost \nevery successful female and sexualizes them regardless of their profession? \nWell... sometimes themselves, but  MOSTLY men.

I think their complaining is \nchildish, unwarranted, and really quite egotistical.","+Canyon Lione The problem is not who the video itself is catered towards. \nIt\u0027s the fact that it unnecessarily discriminates against one group \n(males). We\u0027ve all probably seen the sexist imagery at 1:00 by now. But \nsexism is just not acceptable in the modern society that we now live in. \nPeople aren\u0027t complaining because they are not included, that would be \nchildish. The reason for the backlash is because people do not want to be \nmisrepresented in a negative light. The truth is what matters to people.\n\nI\u0027m going to assume that you\u0027re a Feminist. I would guess that if a man (or \nan individual who was not a woman) decided to state a negative fact about \nwomen which you KNEW was completely unnecessary and blatantly wrong, that \nyou would not be very happy and would tell them the TRUTH.\n\nAnother example of an untruthful \"fact\" about men created through extreme \nFeminism, is that men dislike Feminism because they want to \"maintain the \npatriarchy\". That simply is not the case and is largely outdated in our \nWESTERN (UK and USA) civilization. The reason for backlash, as I have said \nabove, is that people do not like being misrepresented negatively.\n\nWe all work to equality. To reach that equality, we do not have to hurt and \nLIE about another group in order to empower the other. #LOVE","+Vincent Freel Not to be rude, but do you not get that his video was for a \ncampaign? The whole LikeAGirl campaign is directed towards girls who have \nlow confidence because of how people equate their femininity with weakness \n\u0026 helplessness since, in the USA, when something is done \"LikeAGirl\" it\u0027s \nassociated with doing it poorly/weakly/ineffectively.\n\nSaying this is discriminating is like saying a video encouraging people to \naccept who they are is discriminating when it only portrays gay people \nworking through common problems they face...... even when explicitly stated \nthat it\u0027s for a GayPride campaign.\nEVERYTHING does not ALWAYS have to be catered to EVERYONE to whom it may \napply. That\u0027s just vain... America is vain...","+Canyon Lione These are two completely different things, first off, Barbie \nand presumably Spike Lee movies (I haven\u0027t seen them, so I can\u0027t say for \nsure) have a much larger following from girls and black people \nrespectively, where as self confidence affects all people equally, so \nthere\u0027s no reason to direct at only half of those people.\n\nFor another Barbie and Spike Lee movies are a form of entertainment, anyone \ncan just go right ahead and play with/watch those things and at worst \nthey\u0027ll have some social pressures to deal with. *This* however is \nsomething that was expressly made to help people, the two aren\u0027t \ncomparable. This isn\u0027t for entertainment, this is just excluding people \nthat need that help as well.\n\nIt becomes wrong when the groups you\u0027re excluding need just as much of the \nhelp as the ones you\u0027re including.","+Vincent Freel That\u0027s just it. It\u0027s not discrimination! Is Barbie \ndiscriminating against boys who like to play with dolls? No, it\u0027s just \ndirected toward girls. Are Spike Lee movies discriminating against white \npeople who like movies too? No, he\u0027s just appealing to the black \ndemographic. When did it become so wrong to direct a certain \nproduct/video/whatever to a specific group of people (EVEN IF there are \nother groups of people that the product/video/whatever applies to)?","+Canyon Lione And so the way to make them equal is to overcompensate and \ndiscriminate against men in retaliation? Did your parents not teach you \nthat two wrongs don\u0027t make a right?","+Willie Wonker I hope you\u0027re just being facetious, but in case you\u0027re not. \nOf course that\u0027s okay.

If anyone has a \nproblem with that, then they are clearly being immature and insensitive. \nThe issue is when one group (males) is brought down and has \"hate\" aimed \ntowards them through the form of negative stereotypes and exaggerated \ngeneralizations in order to empower another group (females). Everyone is \nfighting for equality. We don\u0027t need to hurt another group.\n\n1:00 is a clear example of outward sexism to men through the negative \ngeneralization of being oppressive.

Oh the horror!","+MadeOfTime Your third point lacks any nuance and just seems like a \nunsubstantiated cookie-cutter talking point.  The \"male-empowering themes\" \nare balanced with an equal or greater number of memes making men look bad, \nand painting \"the good man\" as the exception to the rule, and that\u0027s why \nthe vast majority of villains in movies/games are portrayed as male, while \nthe vast number of idiots/clowns in advertising are male as well.","True, it\u0027d also be relatable for everyone since the tips are for everyone. \nPainting males the enemy? Hm I guess. It looked more like the male symbols \nweren\u0027t representing/antagonizing men themselves I doubt they\u0027d want to put \ndown anyone intentionally but rather represents the people who think \"she \nprobably can\u0027t do this/that right because she\u0027s not male/is a girl.\" It\u0027s a \nwhole lot closer to their theme. No doubt the Male \u003e Female pressure still \nexists (the joys of downtown public transit and retail.)\n\nI feel spikes are a little too simple for all that. The male symbols \nshouldn\u0027t be extremely offensive (clearly that depends on how the viewer \ntakes it here). Could\u0027ve animated that part better...maybe with simplified \nfaces yapping with male symbols in the speech bubbles?","+MadeOfTime Replace the male symbols with generic spikes, and you don\u0027t \ndetract from the point, but also without antagonizing half the population, \neh.

But the phenomenon is \nstrongly prevalent in nature.\n\nIn fact, again, being submissive is feminine whereas being dominant is \nmasculine. A dominant female, is a masculine female. So that proves my \npoint right there. Submission exists FOR Dominance, not the other way \naround.\n\nYou can apply that to all of the traits that involve being feminine VS all \nof the traits that involve being masculine. All the feminine traits are sub \nto the traits that make up masculinity. Look at every other primate \nspecies.

We can change and can go \nagainst nature. So all it takes is for you to stick to whatever perception \nof beauty YOU want. Like, who cares about the ratio? It\u0027s bullshit. \nPersonally I don\u0027t like thinking people like me just because I look pretty \nor some shit.

With that information \nthen we can control what our eyes see by changing how we feel about \nourselves. \n\nRight now I\u0027m reading a book called \"the power of the subconscious mind\" by \nDr. joseph murphy. Now he doesn\u0027t go into this directly but I have found \nhis principles can be reapplied for this kind of thing. His principle idea \nis to pray to the subconscious mind to get our subconscious to accept \ncertain ideas to help people achieve goals in life. He primarily focuses on \ntapping into self healing and life goals etc etc. I believe it can be \nreapplied to our emotional states and our physical perception of ourselves. \nI recommend you buy this book.

And the \nresponder also make generalization about western feminism and how it\u0027s \nunnecessary even though western feminists are worried about other country\u0027s \ntreatment of women as well, so are you going to call them out on that or \njust focus on my single mistake of not individually naming every guy who is \nmisogynistic.","\"Because they attempted to call me out on not using sources, but ironically \nfailed to source anything they said.\"  No, actually that\u0027s exactly what you \ndid.  \nHe just called you out on not presenting any real evidence and making \ngeneralizations.","+loudrockacdc Because they attempted to call me out on not using sources, \nbut ironically failed to source anything they said. Of course I wouldn\u0027t \nhave to source everything, but it\u0027s much easier and more informative for \npeople to research this on their own than to read one or two articles I \nchoose to source.","+Roxas the Rose You know you wouldn\u0027t have to post EVERY source right?  And \nif you knew all this about YouTube not allowing you to post links then why \nwere you complaining about Sky not posting sources.","+loudrockacdc There are too many sources findable by a simple Google search \nfor me to list them all right here; plus, YouTube doesn\u0027t allow you to post \nlinks without editing them, last I checked. The fact I have no energy to \nlink to the 1,000 sources available to everyone has nothing to do with my \ncredibility.","+Roxas the Rose You complain he doesn\u0027t provide sources, then proceed to \ntell him to look up your sources.  Ok","+Sky Alderson You tell me I have no grounded evidence but you fail to give \nsources for what you\u0027re saying. My view of men is my personal experience \nwith them, so I don\u0027t see how I could have a false view when I literally \nsee such behavior first hand. Women are NOT treated equally in the US, are \nNOT paid the same; even though it is illegal; and are NOT deserving of \nhaving to put up with this shitty misogyny. If you need sources, just \nsearch it up. There\u0027s too many, if you ask me.","+Roxas the Rose Your generalization of men is very much misguided. The \nissues you talk about are small and meaningless in the whole picture. \nWestern feminism is largely unnecessary now. We live equally (with women \nactually earning more as of this year in the UK and US). However, there are \nstill women in developing countries that need feminism, so we should \nsupport them.\n\n\nThe truth is, what you stated above has no real grounded evidence. You have \ntaken the easy root of blaming another group for your own problems and \ninsecurities without taking full responsibility for them yourself. If a man \nis oppressing or hurting a women, THAT is wrong. THAT is an issue for \nFeminism. But what you stated is childish at best.\n\n\nI\u0027m sorry that you have these disgusting idea of what a man is, and what \nthey do to women. It really does sadden me. I hope you can see the truth \none day.","+loudrockacdc You do realize that men are the main cause of girls being \nless confident? Everything girls do is mocked and made tedious because it\u0027s \nnot \"manly\" and so girls have to deal with anything they do not being taken \nas seriously because men don\u0027t see the difficulty in female associated \nsports and activities. I have seen my friends struggle to do what they love \nonly to get belittled because what they do is soooo much harder. So, yeah, \nwhen a girl\u0027s confidence is topic, you can bet your ass someone\u0027s gonna \nmention the fact men cause it because until they don\u0027t, you\u0027re just gonna \nhave to get over the fact that people aren\u0027t going to cater to you and \nsugarcoat it.","+Roxas the Rose 1:00","read the desc and look up the hashtag...","+Kuriosity Kills yes but I object to a bit of the symbolism they use","This is about improving confidence","+TheAXXELLALAN I was having a good day... then I saw this coment","They\u0027ve fallen to the stupid liberal agenda","+florzinnha I\u0027m sorry, but where in the western world are \"men constantly \ntrying to put down women\"?","+florzinnha Well there is actually quite a bit of sexism in that lie you \njust told.","+florzinnha u need to understand that you are only looking at negatives. if \nyou have bitchy guys not men in your life that put you down just become \nlesbian and dont blame all of the men. its like me saying that every women \nin the world is a sensitive little fuck like you.","+Sky Alderson There\u0027s no sexism in saying males try to put women down at \nevery opportunity. It\u0027s reality.","+Simora Cheeks The description does not excuse the sexism shown at 1:00 \ntowards males. Sexism is not right in our society and to have a great \ninstitution like TED spreading misguided and outdated stereotypes and \nfeminist generalizations is just not acceptable.","+pennymac16 Well you\u0027d have to be a fucking idiot not to see that \nparticular meaning....","+The Lost Tiara feminism hates men.","+Mrdavid\nSomething makes me doubt that they have read a comprehensive amount of it. \nThen again, neither have I.","+pennymac16 From research.","+Mrdavid\nI wonder how people get this idea","+The Lost Tiara Cause DNA predicts 90% of the behavior and intellect of a \nperson.","+ineffable Whune\n\"Of course it doesn\u0027t prevent anyone from treating it as a (flawed) \nexample; but...\nMost people are not critically analyzing whether what they are being \npresented is an accurate representation of reality\"\n\nI completely agree.\nIt\u0027s not so much about the accuracy, though, I think. It\u0027s more about \nwhether people will interpret stuff as representative of the whole rather \nthan as an unrepresentative example.

I would \nagree.","+pennymac16 \n\nIt\u0027s like saying that if I make a vid all black characters wailing on \nsingle white person as being why white people develop insecurity... that \nanyone\u0027s  failure to think critically about that polarizing nonsense \nsomehow absolves me of my irresponsibility in making said hypothetical \nvideo.\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nFact: the girl in the animation is surrounded by gender symbols projecting \nat her in a menacing way\n\nFact: all of those symbols are male\nno female symbols were included in the circle of hostility.\n\nThe implication is simple and clear.\ngirl vs boys:\n\nPoor girl\u0027s sense of worth eroded by hostility of the opposite gender.\n\nOf course it doesn\u0027t prevent anyone from treating it as a (flawed) example; \nbut...\nMost people are not critically analyzing whether what they are being \npresented is an accurate representation of reality:\nThey just take it in; on a largely subconscious level.\n\nThis is why the animation is irresponsible:\nIt implies girl vs boy psychology.\n\n[Viewers responsibility to think critically about polarizing nonsense such \nas this] ...is an entirely separate issue; and thus doesn\u0027t negate my point:\nThe [irresponsibility of the authors in making the implication of girl VS \nboys].","+ineffable Whune\nI can see why you get to this conclusion. But the animation alone does not \nprevent anyone from treating it as an example. It\u0027s not like the animation \ndemanded it to be seen as set in stone or anything.\nSo \"We - guys - are all just jerky jerks...\" is not the correct thing to \ntake away from this, albeit people will likely fall for that these days.","\"Meaning lies in the eye of the beholder.\"\n+pennymac16 \n... you do realize the the symbol of the circle and arrow is the symbol of \nmale gender... right?\n\nlol... this isn\u0027t \"eye of the beholder\"\n\nits simple fact:\nThe vids animation implied that girls sense of worth is eroded exclusively \nby male peers; no females involved.\n\nWe - guys - are all just jerky jerks... the YA fiction trend of \"mean \ngirls\" is just disinformation to divide all of girls being nice to each \nother all the times...","hi I love you","Chill, it\u0027s a video, it doesn\u0027t really matter, I didn\u0027t even notice until \nyou pointed it out","+The Lost Tiara because we all face different problems or different \nversions of the same problems and everyone is sitting on their side saying, \nTHAT DOESN\u0027T HAPPEN TO YOU and/or IT DOESN\u0027T EXIST while looking for \nsomebody to blame.

","+florzinnha then why is the woman in this video getting hit by the MEN \nsymbol and other stuff","+iXbeXy Hm...Okay, cool. I\u0027ll sum up the video a little then. The video \nsays:\n\nConfidence can come from: \n1) Genes and brain function, 2) How you\u0027re treated, 3) The choices you \nmake, risks you take, and how you respond to challenges. This one plays a \npretty major role.\n\nTips:\n1) Quick fix/pick-me-up, 2) Believe in your ability to improve, 3) Practice \nfailure\n\nThe video ends with: You\u0027ll feel pretty great because you\u0027ll have gained a \nbetter understanding after gaining greater knowledge and understanding. \nThis is confidence.\n\nSince you say this can\u0027t apply to males in general, this means you say:\nMale confidence isn\u0027t affected by internal and external factors.\nGuys are incapable of boosting their energy, believing in themselves, or \npersevering in tough situations.\nand Guys don\u0027t feel a sense of accomplishment after completing their \ngoals/looking back on their improvement.\n\n(feel free to ignore me since we both have better things to do but I just \nwanted to show you what your reply would mean)","+iXbeXy no, it shouldn\u0027t be specified, idiot. when the video is aimed at \nmen they don\u0027t specify, idiot. get used to it.","+florzinnha like i said it should be specified, and dont call me idiot, you \nidiot","+iXbeXy the title is not misleading, idiot.","+chelseam_800 then change the misleading the title.","+MadeOfTime no it dosent u dumb mate?","+Spliter dude i click on this video for boosting my confidence, but title \nis way different and misleading. thats why i was raging","because the tips work for both genders","+iXbeXy Read the description box...the reason why this video focused mostly \non women is because it was sponsored by Always the company that sells \nsanitary pads for women. I don\u0027t think that they were purposely trying to \nexclude the male gender","+florzinnha ok heres the thing:\n1.meninism is a fucking joke based on feminizm, which in itself is a bunch \nof bullshit\n2. every comment about that is a fucking joke\n3. why did you respond to so many of the comments","+iXbeXy dude, what\u0027s wrong with it having only girls? Really, what is the \nproblem? Does it suddenly stop applying to guys? If so then if an eg tech \nconference only has guys presenting stuff does that mean it doesn\u0027t apply \nto women and they can\u0027t learn from it?","+iXbeXy Interesting. \n\nIf this video had only male characters, women wouldn\u0027t say anything because \nwe are used to it. We wouldn\u0027t think they are suggesting that only men have \nconfidence issues or that the video is only for men.","+SockTaters III not all caracters are women. you got the one guy who is a \nobstacle on the womans path to confidence. and then there is alse the male \ngender symbols attacking the woman a clear representation of men.","+tmvk97 I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s oriented towards girls because it\u0027s about \nconfidence.

On a site that is literally about \nposting whatever videos you want.\n\nIf I make an educational video, I can be sitting on the toilet shitting \nwhile I make it, all I want. so again, what is with this sheer arrogance \nthat makes you think you have any business telling people what should and \nshouldn\u0027t in regards to their own video.\n\nThat\u0027s the only sensible argument I need.\n\n\u003e\u003e\"What do you mean nobody is being hurt?

If they can\u0027t separate their personal beliefs and the content \nthey create professionally, then we have a problem. I don\u0027t want hamburgers \nat my wedding just because the wedding planner likes mcd\u0027s.\n\nWhat do you mean nobody is being hurt?

That\u0027s silly and you know it. \n\nYou literally have no sensible arguments.","+Bence Gál\nIt was designed by feminists. It has every reason to be there. The problem \nmore is in your own self-absorbed delusion that the world should be a \nmirror image of what you think should be.\n\nEven though, there are other humans who have free agency, and if they \nchoose to spread whatever message... apparently they aren\u0027t supposed to \nhave free agency and aren\u0027t supposed to diversify from your world view.\n\nSeriously, let\u0027s be real, it\u0027s not wrong because... nobody is being \nhurt/violated.","+Master Chaos Not even close, sweetie. \n\nThis way, it\u0027s just a couple of upset youtube-comments, big fucking whoop. \nBut the other way around? God help us. Public ted-ed apology, frontpage \nnews coverage, blog entries and response videos, demonstration in the \npathetic form of mass downvoting this vid, a swarm of angry letters to \nYoutube, etc etc, you get the point. The whole internet, in 24hrs tops, \nwould hear of the video that LITERALLY makes women the enemy. You can be \nsure the outrage would be immense. \n\nWe aren\u0027t outraged. It\u0027s simple, really: Can you spread your feminist ideas \nin dedicated videos in dedicated channels? Sure you can. Is it wrong to \nmake an educational video covertly using feminist ideology where it has no \nplace at all? Yes. End of story.","+Bence Gál \nYes exactly, //you\u0027re as bad as feminists by being just as much of a \npissbaby as them//. You get it. Good job(sarcasm).","+TheNeurall What a reason to be upset.

I\u0027m currently using it.","+Suoarski thanks man, I will check this out.","+Francisco Zattoni I\u0027d really reccomend this app, it\u0027s incredibly useful \nfor vocabulary and you can use it pretty much anywhere.\n\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribe-japanese-master-vocabulary/id640052740?mt\u003d8","+Pippa Pipe Cool hahaha, and this video is quite a boost, isn\u0027t it? Good \nlock with your studies :D","+Francisco Zattoni omg! I\u0027m doing the exact same thing! I started studying \n5 days ago :D","+OwNeD05 Thanks!","+Graver Got it, I know Duolingo, but I haven\u0027t used it yet for Japanese. \nI\u0027m gonna take a look, thanks","+Coxy002605 That\u0027s right, I\u0027m using Anki for this, and it\u0027s been pretty \nuseful.","+lizzy_ Yeahhh I think I have to! Focusing all my brain\u0027s intellectual \ncapacity into it, live with it, dream with it, being it, no kidding lol. \nBut for sure I have to put a lot of effort on it.","+Francisco Zattoni Spaced repetition is really useful, especially because \nJapanese doesn\u0027t have an alphabet.","Duolingo is a pretty decent app for that\nI learned a bit of Italian within a few weeks but then I stopped because \nI\u0027m lazy. Maybe you\u0027ll have better motivation","+Francisco Zattoni Good luck with that.","+lizzy_ Thank you bro!","It doesn\u0027t help that in the description says \"Lesson made in partnership \nwith the *Always # LikeAGirl campaign*\"\nBut I think it\u0027s better to focus on the video\u0027s message being said rather \nthan the actual video.","+VivianStorm I think the biggest problem arises when people *assume* \nsomeone is getting 90% of the pie, when they are not.","Hm, I\u0027d argue that \"the social pressures of  your environment\" added with \nthat image of a girl surrounded by male signs mean \"do not be intimidated \nby a male-dominated anything\" or some old \"smash the patriarchy\", that is \nhonestly what I interpret when I see it. Maybe the creator of the vid could \nexplain.","+ VivianStorm I agree that the people who are focusing on it just being \naimed towards women are being slightly childish. But, the scene at 1:00 is \nclearly implying that woman are oppressed by men and ONLY men. There is no \n\"misunder[standing]\". Sexism is prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination \non the basis of sex. That scene is a perfect example of prejudice as well \nas stereotyping.\n\n\nWe don\u0027t need to hurt one group (males) in order to empower another \n(women). Everyone is after equality, we should not hurt one another in the \nprocess.","That\u0027s not the only complaint. The girl at 1:00 is surrounded by male \nsymbols, that IS sexist","There is no mention to exclusively girl issues in the video. The moment at \n1:00 is a world with an overwhelmingly male point of view, though I can see \nhow that can be misunderstood. And, sigh, yes, everyone has problems. But \nyou would not tell a person who is discriminated, say a black person \"it is \nnot just you who has problems, whites do too\". It is like there is this big \npie, and a certain type of people have 90% of it. Other type of people \ntakes a slice and suddendly the first group is yelling \"my pie, my pie, my \npie!\" I have been aware of countless things, say videos like these, \ndirected to humans in general but featuring only males. Would it really \nkill you to have some with only females?","+VivianStorm because male is default. female must have a reason. GOD IS \nMALE FFS","+VivianStorm Wait two wrongs, NEVER make a right. I thought feminism is \ntrying to be about equality, but this video contradicts that. \n\nIt\u0027s not just girls whom have problems in this life.","+VivianStorm At first I thought everyone was overreacting, and they might \nbe a bit but I see where this is coming from. It\u0027s not just that there\u0027s a \nfocus on girl characters, it\u0027s things like what you see at 1:00 about \nsocial pressure. That\u0027s kinda cliche and can be seen as sexist because of \nhow simplistic it is. The animation just seems a little biased or just \nindelicate in the best case scenario. The VO and the title are pretty \ngeneral but the animation seems inadequate and focuses on girl issues \nwithout much nuance for no apparent reason.","I find all sorts of propaganda to be weird and untrustworthy.","+htf5555 which country is it?","Apparently","Hmmm wher u frm dear","+Altash Khan So I don\u0027t seem like a rude person if my wording was strange. ","+Lizzy Simba in which case;??","Yes.","+Akaineth I wanted to apologise, just in case.","+Lizzy Simba I didn\u0027t take it as a rude comment. I really didn\u0027t know it \nwas a sponsored video, so your comment gave some context to the video","+florzinnha I don\u0027t fully accept that statement; \"women wouldn\u0027t say \nanything because we are used to it\". There is a lot of focus on gender \nequality in media (e.g. Bechdel test).\n\nBut even if your statement is correct (which i don\u0027t believe) using only \nfemales is not the same as using only males. I\u0027m all for equality, but from \na historic point of view a man is more gender neutral. using males has \nalways been the standard (which is a thing that is changing and should be \nchanging). From this perspective it is not strange that more people will \nnotice it if only females are used.\nFurthermore: males are used in this video, just not as the main character, \nor dealing with cofidence issues. The latter offers an extra problem in my \neyes. It is a male stereotype that men should be confidend, so to debunk \nthis stereotype. would be good (for a society and for equality). Video\u0027s \nlike these should also depict males with these issues.\n\nI\u0027m giving this way more weight than the orriginal joke intended, sorry for \nthis.","+Akaineth  Interesting. \n\nIf this video had only male characters, women wouldn\u0027t say anything because \nwe are used to it. We wouldn\u0027t think they are suggesting that only men have \nconfidence issues.","+Akaineth And sorry if I sounded rude. I wasn\u0027t trying to. ","+Lizzy Simba Ah thanks, that explains a lot.","+florzinnha Ik was sort of a joke because all charaters dealing with \nconfidence are female in the video. All sorts of races are dipicted at 0:36, \nbut only women... \nI thought it was strange because like you say, all the advice could apply \nto men.","+Akaineth no. Why?\n\nYou can take all the advices and apply in your life. No one will stop you.","+Lizzy Simba \"Cis men don\u0027t really fit into their target audience\". Why, do \ngay men fit?\nAlso, if this was a video on firearms safety sponsored by a firearm making \ncompany, and only featured men, would you be ok with it? Don\u0027t women need \nfirearm safety guidelines too? Don\u0027t boys need self confidence too?","This is sponsored by Always, a company that makes sanitary pads. \nCis men don\u0027t really fit into their target audience for this producut. \nIt would be nice to see some representation of depressed boys and men, but \nI guess it makes sense for this video to use women as their characters.","Look \nwithin 20 years of your life you will definitely have a boyfriend or \ngirlfriend. the odds are over 95% I would bet  ","+Liam Vance - Statistically? Are you kidding? There are a LOT of lonely, \nsingle people and there are more now than ever before.\n\"You\u0027ll get a GF/BF soon enough, everyone does\" is such bullshit, and is \nonly said by people who doesn\u0027t know any other way, and who can\u0027t be arsed \nto actually empathize with the person in question.","Statistically you will wind up with someone eventually \nEveryone does","Like the other guy said...if you keep thinking this way you\u0027ll never have \none.

Rape has been a crime for...  how long? \n \"Spousal rape\" is a 20th century term.  Not long ago, your wife couldn\u0027t \neven cry rape against her husband.","+florzinnha The reason a lot of men hate feminism is because it\u0027s moved far \nfrom its well-intentioned roots, and is now largely occupied by hysterical \nand irritating ingrates who are impossible to debate with because they \ndon\u0027t deal in logic or facts. A lot of women hate the current brand of \nfeminism as well, for the same reason.\n\nMen do not hate women. History is not a black and white struggle between \nthe genders. We are not enemies - when will feminists realise this?","+daredevilpwn\nShe just got that backwards, quite usual. It\u0027s women\u0027s loss not men\u0027s gain \nif anything. It is true and it comes from our unconsciouss and thousands of \nyears of objectifying women, mere 50 years of happy shit are not going to \nchange that so fast. Of course I\u0027m not denying that feminism is utter \nbullshit.","+florzinnha Are you talking about the western world? If so then citation \nneeded. Show me evidence that men in the west are benefiting from gender \ninequality.","+florzinnha If you believe that the reason men \"hate\" feminism is because \nof them benefiting from it, your clearly misguided and slightly deluded.\n\n1) Men do not benefit in any way from (now non-existent) gender equality \n(in the UK and USA).\n2) Men \"hate\" Feminism only because of the misguided \"facts\" that are \nstated about the group. The generalisations are almost always wrong (when \ncommenting on Western gender equality issues). How would you feel if your \nentire gender was hated against due to a few indiviuals lying about the \ntruth? If you look at it unbiasedly, you\u0027ll understand the problem.\n\nCould you also comment on my previous comments about Western feminism? I\u0027ll \ncopy it over.\n\u0027It\u0027s just no longer true that patriarchy is a problem (on the scale that I \nbelieve you think it is). *When I say that, I only talk about the UK and \nUSA. In developing countries (and developed countries like Japan with \nhistorical/cultural ties to sexism and male control) there is a patriarchy \nand a clear need for feminism as an equality movement.\nWestern feminism is largely selfish in the fact that it complains about \n\"first world problems\" and ignores the actual problems in other countries \nwhere feminism is needed.\u0027\n\nOnce again, I am only talking about Western Feminism being misguided. I am \nincredibly pro Feminism in every other country apart from the UK and USA \n(in which there is clear evidence to show that women benefit more than men \nmoney-wise and socio-economically). I am a Feminist (excluding in the UK \nand USA).","+Sky Alderson I\u0027m not generalizing anything. I\u0027m stating a fact. Of course \nmen benefit from discrimination against women and gender inequality in \ngeneral. That\u0027s why most of them hate Feminism. ","Sadly, that generalisation is very much outdated in today\u0027s society. It\u0027s \njust no longer true that patriarchy is a problem (on the scale that I \nbelieve you think it is). *When I say that, I only talk about the UK and \nUSA.

Men do not benefit from any discrimination upon a woman, just \nas much as a woman does not benefit from the discrimination. I would \nstrongly recommend avoiding that misguided generalisation from now on.","+Sky Alderson Women are oppressed by men. I suppose they are talking about \ngender, not race or any other type of discrimination, so they are right. In \na patriarchy, If a woman discriminate against another woman, she is \ndiscriminating against herself too. Only men benefit from it.","+florzinnha 1:00 the symbolism shown is blatant sexism. It implies that \nwomen are oppressed by men and ONLY men, which is an unjust and outdated \nfeminist stereotype.\n\n\nSexism is not right in our modern society.

In 1928 the government changed the \nofficial alphabet that all of the Turkish people use and Ottoman citizens \nused in the past. This happened because the regime didn\u0027t want its people \nto know about their history. All of the people who knew reading and writing \nat the time were illiterated in one night. Because the alphabet was \ncomplately different. Public education and all other official writings \nshould be in new alphabet. And to keep people learning more about their \nhistory and tides with their ancestors they established an institution \ncalled TDK which is short for Turkish Language Institution. This institute \nmade new word for old words to complately erase historical bonds on \nlanguage. You can look for all the words in Turkish that changed by this \ninstitution by force, here: \nhttp://www.turkalemiyiz.com/asil/sozluk.asp?id\u003d1\n\nSome of the old words are forgotten in the time but some of them remained \nbecause the new alternatives were really stupid. For exapmle: ad?l is the \nmade up word for zamir which mean pronoun in English.\nAnd also kamal ataturk is like the big brother in 1984 because in all state \ninstitutes must have his portrait hanged in every room, and also in some \nprivate institutions. He is always watching everyone like big brother.\n\nTurkeyin the primary school education and high school education students \nspout The Turkish Nationalist Anthem every week and also they spout the \noath march in everyday. At the same time every class has an Ataturk \nportrait and Turkish flag. According to Billing (1995), flags are not the \nonly symbols of modern statehood. Coins and bank notes typically bear \nnational emblems which remain unnoticed in daily financial transactions. So \nin the routine business of flagging is not a conscious activity (Billing, \n1995, p. 41). These routine activities are done in order to strengthen the \npeoples idea and sense of nationalism. So the routine activities like \nmarches, pictures on money or the flags are not conscious activity, people \ncannot realize them.\n\nPeople learn the history in just one perspective; it is Ataturks point of \nview. Turkish history books also have portrait of Ataturk on the \nfrontispiece. For example, existing Kurdish ethnic is rejected by this \nperspective and this doctrine is taught in the schools. When the students \nstart the primary school, they learn there is no Kurt in the book, in the \nhistory and it causes big shock and trauma in terms of Kurdish students. \nThis situation causes the big discrimination between the race and it causes \nalso starting an ideological battlefield between Kurdish and Turkish \nnationalisms.\n\nTheir brains are washed.

Its bad enough that \nmost people in real life miss the point.\n\nOrwell thought that nuanced. deliberate language is power, not just power \nfor the state but power for the citizen. He believed quite literally that \nthe pen is mightier than the sword, that it can be empowering for the weak \nand disempowered. He wanted people to know every meaning, nuance and \nimplication of every single word they spoke and he wanted people to \nunderstand the meaning, nuance and implication of every single word \nsomebody else spoke. When the meaning of words are undermined and muddled \nto the point that a conversation cannot occur you cannot develop a nuanced \nopinion. For the record, the phrase \"politcal correctness\" is doublespeak. \nBe frank, you have a belief that somebody else thinks is offensive and \nabhorrent. The phrase \"political correctness\" victimizes your speech, and \ntherefore, your belief while demonizing their speech, and therefore, their \nbelief. Its disingenuous and paints a story where the people interacting \naren\u0027t equal. Don\u0027t sugarcoat the fact that you have a belief that is \n(currently) irreconcilable with somebody else\u0027s. Every single mentally \ncompetent adult alive has a lifestyle and belief that another will find \nobscene, gross, offensive, egregious, abhorrent, hateful, bigoted, vile, \ndisgusting, etc. Own that rather than contributing to doublespeak while at \nthe same time decrying it. That is the easy way out and in this instance \nits the wrong way.\n\nAdditionally, surveillance was unnecessary in Oceania, or at least it no \nlonger became necessary at the point in which the events take place. Orwell \neven made a point of that in the first third of the book. They didn\u0027t need \nevidence. You knew you were guilty of thoughtcrime, and you were guilty in \na manner that was so unavoidable that it wouldn\u0027t be unreasonable to \npresume that anybody the state persecuted was guilty of it. It makes \neverybody too worried about the consequences of themselves getting involved \nto get help others. Furthermore, speaking out against the persecution of \nanother citizen would mean questioning authority, and since questioning \nauthority is thoughtcrime anybody who speaks out is logically a bonafide \nthoughtcriminal, which means persecution would be swift and inevitible. \nThis has been so ingrained and conditioned into the people in just one \ngeneration, Winston Smith\u0027s generation, that surveillance is completely and \nutterly unecessary. The cameras are unneeded, expensive and impractical. \nThey round you up for whatever reason, it matters not, because it doesn\u0027t \nmatter to the population what truth or justice is, it matters that it isn\u0027t \nhappening to them.?","Isn\u0027t Orwell\u0027s most popular novel Animal Farm??","Cool animation?","Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings, Social Justice...

Most atheists acknowledge \nthere are many Gods and that none of them are real. Typically when people \ntalk about a god it must be both supernatural and able to intervene in the \nuniverse to qualify for this word.

You know there are other forms of socialism besides \nMarxist, right?  The Nazis were originally nationalist socialists. \n Nationalsozialistische is where we get the term \"Nazi.\"  It was a free \nworkers party which believed in nationalized success especially after their \ndefeat in WWI.  The believed the economic way to move in the right \ndirection (not to be confused with rightwing) was through economic \nsocialism - such as social welfare to German middle class workers, business \nregulation, and profit-sharing.  This was at odds of Marxist socialism \nwhich became communistic.  They were also very xenophobic obviously.\n\nItalian fascism was a product of Giovanni Gentile, who\u0027s economic models \nwere very similar to the Nazis except that instead of a worker\u0027s party \ncontrolling the private markets, centralized authoritarianism was needed to \nredistribute the market\u0027s money for nationalistic and military endeavors. \n Hitler later copied Mussolini\u0027s model in Italy as his military conquest \nbecame so vital.  Gentile, btw, was a big fan of Karl Marx\u0027s economic \nphilosophy, although he believed his own version was more practical.  They \ncalled fascism the \"third alternative\" to capitalism and Marxism.\n\nFascism was an ideology that conflicts with liberty however in that the \ngovernment controls all aspects of society in order to serve the collective \nand push for egalitarianism.  These are all leftwing attributes.  In fact, \nUS progressives like FDR stole some of Italy\u0027s fascist plans when \nimplementing government regulations and federal programs.  Social Security \nwas a Italian fascist scheme for example. \nhttp://www.dailyherald.com/article/20121003/discuss/710039968/","+Boat 1.

You can\u0027t just throw it in with the right because they were a \nmilitary power.  Military has nothing to do with ideology.

The government controlled the \nmarket in order to better the state\u0027s goals such as their military \nendeavors.  Hitler hated capitalism and communism equally though.  He just \nunderstood in order to fund his conquest he needed German\u0027s economy to fund \nit.  He still nationalized plenty of businesses nonetheless.\n\nThe closest thing to fascism today is progressivism in which the state \nregulates the market and taxes production in order to fulfill the state\u0027s \nplans.  You even have candidates like Bernie Sanders who are mixing \nprogressivism with their own brand of nationalism.

They conflate capitalism with sexist and racist \noppression, and these ideas became the roots of most of the 1960\u0027s \ncounterculture. That counter-culture in turn became the basis for most \nidentity politics movements, most of which try to distance themselves from \nthe marxist ideas at their roots.\n\nIt\u0027s literally just pointing out the interrelation, which people like \nyourself seem adamant to deny exists.\n\nWhy is it you just can\u0027t admit it? You personally don\u0027t seem to have a \nproblem with marxist thought. If I had to guess, it seems like you might be \na supporter. Why not just admit that there are definite aspects of \ninterrelation between say, marxism and feminism? What do you stand to lose \nif you acknowledge that?\n\n\"Marxism presupposes economic class, not as personal identity which is \ntaken as a product of ideology, but as reality obscured by ideology.\"\n\nPresupposing an economic class on people who would otherwise not consider \nthemselves as a part of that class IS creating an identity for them. It\u0027s \nsaying, \"hey you\u0027re all workers, right? Well then you all have a shared \nidentity AS workers\" then it uses that as a base of populist power to try \nand create the desired change in economic systems.\n\nThis is politics 101. You create a sense of identity based on your \nideology, whatever that is. The only difference between older forms of \npolitics and identity politics is that identity politics are based on the \ninherent identities of the potential constituents rather than trying to \nform one based on ideals.\n\nThe standard political identity goes something like \"I\u0027m an X \n[Democrat/Republica/Libertarian/Anarchist/Whatever] and I believe in tenets \nA,B,C, and D. If you believe in tenets A,B,C, and D, you should be X too!\"\n\nIdentity politics goes something like \"You! You\u0027re an X [Woman/Ethnic \nMinority/Sexual Minority/Whatever]! You should join my group Y - we fight \nfor the rights of X\u0027s!\"\n\nThe technique is exactly as you describe from Marxism - \"It presupposes a \nclass as a reality obscured by ideology\", but then it pushes an ideology \nonto that identity.\n\nIf you can\u0027t understand that, then you\u0027re missing the forest for the trees.\n\nI mean, if a group of workers realizes they\u0027re all part of a working class \nindependently, they may not necessarily turn to marxism. In fact, many in \nthe early labor unions in the 1870\u0027s-1890\u0027s didn\u0027t. Marxism didn\u0027t exist \nyet, but you still saw unionization. The shared group identity was there \nand so was the feeling of fighting for political recognition and rights for \nworkers, but it wasn\u0027t about overturning the capitalist system from the \nground up.\n\nMarxism took a process that already existed - labor unions forming for \nbetter rights for their shared group identity - then said that this was an \n\"inevitable realization\" when it was very patently not the case considering \nthe many industries where unions did not form, and then said that again, \nthe inevitable was the rising of these groups was to overturn their \ncapitalist masters - which ended up happening but not at all in the way \npredicted. Most communist uprisings occurred in countries where only \npartial industrialization had taken root and which were still primarily \nagrarian.\n\nMarx got a LOT wrong. I\u0027m not even going to get into how his supposed \ncollectivist utopias all became oppressive totalitarian regimes.\n\nAs for this \"You\u0027re cherry-picking the fringe, and pretending it\u0027s the \nmainstream\" - hardly.\n\nWhen all it takes is a single search through google to turn up hundreds of \nexamples of something, it sure doesn\u0027t seem like that\u0027s \"fringe\". I\u0027ve seen \nso many examples of every single thing I\u0027ve mentioned over the past few \nyears - and plenty more examples of less extreme prejudice - that even \ntrying to list them all would be impossible.\n\nBut you don\u0027t want to attempt empathy and want to assume malevolence, so \nyou ask for an impossible standard to be met:\n\n\"I want examples!\"\n\nExamples shown.\n\n\"Those are just cherry picked!\" (unspoken demand for more examples)\n\n[this could continue on forever, it\u0027s a BS tactic used by people who can\u0027t \njustify their own ideals]\n\nYou don\u0027t want me to prove you wrong, you just want to criticize what \npeople you disagree with have to say. You don\u0027t want to offer a \nconstructive opinion, you just want to be right.\n\nWell, fine. You\u0027re right. There\u0027s absolutely no links between Marxism and \nFeminism, that\u0027s just a crazy idea thousands of other people have noticed \nover the last 60 years. There are absolutely no links between \"anti-racist\" \ngroups like the Students for a Democratic Society, and their fringe \nsplinter groups like the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation \nArmy despite the fact that many of the same people were involved in both. \nThese groups never attacked anyone or murdered anyone, those people all \njust died in freak accidents. Yeah, that\u0027s it. There\u0027s no racism in modern \nIdentity groups who think that White Privilege is an invisible all \noppressive force keeping them down, or that since Racism means \"Power + \nPrivilege\" they can\u0027t be racist in when they say White people are all evil, \nor that they should all die. Absolutely all of this has been imagined over \nthe last 60 years. It was all an illusion.\n\nNow that you\u0027re right, what exactly should we do about all that contrary \nevidence that\u0027s frozen forever on the internet, in libraries, and on film?","+SonofaGlitch \"Marxism is entirely about creating an identity based on \nclass.\"\n\nIncorrect. Marxism presupposes economic class, not as personal identity \nwhich is taken as a product of ideology, but as reality obscured *by* \nideology.\n\n\"stuff like \"kill all men\"\"\n\nSome man-haters call themselves feminists. Some gun-fetishists call \nthemselves christians. What point are you making?\n\nYou\u0027re cherry-picking the fringe, and pretending it\u0027s the mainstream.

That\u0027s \nliterally the whole point, \"we are all of the working class and must rise \nup together\".\n\nYou\u0027re absolutely moronic if you missed the core tenet of what marxist \nideology attempts to achieve.\n\nAs for anti-racist groups being racist?\n\nBlack lives matter protests have segregated themselves during protests \nbased entirely on race. The Black Panther party has historically advocated \nfor more segregation of black communities, arming them, and then becoming \nindependent of the states they live in. The National Council of La Raza is \na Chicano group focused on the concept of \"La Raza\" or racial pride, and \nthey\u0027re also really into separatism based on race. It doesn\u0027t take long \nstrolling through any feminist or anti-racist social media profile before \nyou start seeing stuff like \"kill all men\" or \"kill all white people\". \nFeminist groups in particular are big fans of male-female segregation, just \nrecently the labor party in the UK suggested women\u0027s only rail cars. \nWomen\u0027s only \"safe spaces\" are consistent fixtures in the rhetoric of \ncampus feminists, and I recently met a feminist debate team captain from \nthe UK who thought it fine that she should compete in a women\u0027s only debate \nleague, even though debate isn\u0027t a sport - there are no physical \ndifferences due to sexual dimorphism that will make someone\u0027s rhetoric \nbetter or worse.\n\nThe list goes on and on and on, and again, you really only need to look at \nthese groups from an impartial point of view and it very quickly becomes \nobvious that they\u0027re as bigoted as what they say they oppose.\n\nAs for the Frankfurt School \"conspiracy\" . . . are you saying that the \nFrankfurt school/The Institute for Social Research didn\u0027t exist despite it \nbeing a matter of public record? Are you saying that members of the this \nschool weren\u0027t the avowed marxists that they all publicly identified as? \nThat they didn\u0027t move to Columbia university when Nazis came to power in \nGermany despite that this is again, a matter of public record? Or that \nHerbert Marcuse - a rather prominent member of these institutions - didn\u0027t \nwrite Eros \u0026 Civilization, a work that became a major part of the 1960\u0027s \ncounter-culture movement\u0027s philosophies?\n\nBecause if you\u0027re denying all of those things which are all independently \nverifiable facts - hell, I have a copy of Marcuse\u0027s book on my shelf (but I \nsuppose that must be my imagination) - then you\u0027re the one who believes in \nconspiracies buddy.\n\nBut again, like most people who want to twist truth around you look for a \nconvenient label to use against people or events you\u0027re pre-disposed to \ndisagree with. You want to deny history because of lies you\u0027ve been told in \nthe present.\n\nAgain, I\u0027m not the one being Orwellian.

So i was searching if i can find some criticism on it or if i am \nalone. And so i was reading and searching for reviews and that\u0027s when i \nfound his and was kinda happy that many issues that i had with 1984 were \nmentioned in his review since i admired Asimov\u0027s work a lot for almost a \ndecade. \nMaybe the reason why i did not liked it so much is that i read about \ndictatorship, propaganda and manipulation of the people before reading \nOrwell so it was not such a new idea to me. You just can control people \nmuch better with manipulation than with oppression. Illusion of freedom is \nmuch more effective than direct control. There was nothing surprising for \nme in 1984. Parts of it seemed trivial and parts just seemed absurd and not \nvery thought through and the most of the rest was just boring. And ending \nwas not surprising at all, it was just gory and difficult to read. There \nwere very few things to like about 1984 for me but i thought that i would \nenjoy it before reading it. \nThe main problem for me was that i just don\u0027t think that humans work that \nway. I am aware that people can act like animals or just in purely evil \nfashion and that they can be controlled, manipulated and so on, but there \nare just very few specific ways to make them act like that and the one \nOrwell described was not one of them for the most part. So for me, there \nwere basically no humans in that book (generally speaking) because \npopulation in 1984 think and act in a way that humans cant. In reality the \nsociety would not be stable (just imagine the mental issues (paranoia, \nfear, mental breakdowns). Then there is the fact that people could \nbasically put each other in a prison (out of spite, revenge, anything)). \nThose are huge problems even if we would forget about the \"who would watch \nthe watchers\" argument. In reality i don\u0027t think it would go that far, \nbecause there would be unrest and overthrown of the government, that\u0027s why \ndictators usually have a class of citizens which they spoil with many \nbenefits. And because basically none of that was present i could not relate \nto the population of 1984.","+stardude692001 hey Stardude! I\u0027m looking forward to reading the essay that \nNeuro sent me.

He makes rather too passionate note of \nhis objection to the lesser status of the United States to Britain in \nOceania while forgetting the writers tend to set their works in familiar \nplaces. Asimov also feels the need to equate technological advancement with \nscience fiction which, while commonly associated, are not mutually \ndefinitive, Philip K. Dick\u0027s \"The Man in the High Castle\" disproves this \npoint. Asimov\u0027s understanding of humanity is not in question, his \nauthorship of the Foundation series demonstrates this quite clearly, but \nfrankly in this review I feel he is being rather too narrow-minded in terms \nof what the genre is and how it should be used.","+William Wilson I like 1984, but considering it a suboptimal use of one\u0027s \nresources to argue is a valid reason not to argue provided one does not \nclaim that said position is a moral high ground.","+doggonemess i don\u0027t get your reference? it\u0027s been years since i read it.","+geekgroupie42 You know, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a single bit of real meat in \nit.

You are not arrested \nfor being a rude person to other people. Also, lovely false-equivalencies.","+Asterra2\nThis video is about clearing up a misconception of a term used without any \nreal grasp of what author was trying to say. This is important because \npeople using the term incorrectly are doing the very thing Orwell was \ntrying to warn people about: circumventing critical thought on topics that \nare nuanced. What Orwell was trying to get across is how language shapes \nperception and the video illustrates the dangers of taking a term out of \ncontext for that very reason. The OP, yourself and the nice bi-racial \nlesbian went right back  to, respectively, using pretentious language and \nconvoluted sentences, baseless assumptions about totalitarianism (the video \nspecifically mentioned people incorrectly associating the term with) and \nusing the term incorrectly in a way that is literally ironic. \n\nClearly, I have no choice but to agree that this video was far to subtle \nfor some watching.","The video spends most of its time going out of its way to underscore the \nfallout of a population which allows itself to believe single-word \ndismissals of criticism.  In essence, the title of the video is what you \nposit, and the contents are what I described.  Between the two, given the \ntiming and the fact that social outrage is the most conspicuous current \ntopic of contention, I gauge that my judgement is on target.  It\u0027s not \nexactly an act of reading between the lines; even the video\u0027s thumbnail is \nspecifically the image of the fellow using a dismissive label with zero \nself-awareness.\n\nPerhaps the message should have been made less subtle for everyone?","+Asterra2 You missed the point of the video as well. It isn\u0027t a slam and \nit\u0027s not about \" a breed totalitarianism\" either. It\u0027s about the importance \nof truly understanding a concept and the impact of misunderstood concepts \non modern thinking, much like the video on what irony actually means. The \nvideo is trying to inform and move people away from the kind of uncritical \nassumptions based on misunderstanding the concept that you and OP are \nmaking.","+Space Marine Do you not see how this poorly worded offering is exactly the \nkind of thing the video was talking about? Don\u0027t you see how your simply \nlabeling views that differ from your own as tyranny, when that isn\u0027t what \nthe word means? Wasn\u0027t the video just talking about how Orwell warned of \nthe use of pretentious terms (like faux-liberalism) and convoluted sentence \nstructures? Are you trying to be ironic?","+gentlemanREX Au contraire, disagreeing with radical leftists doesn\u0027t make \none against equality or tolerance. This itself is an example of Orwellian \ntactics as performed by Progressives (who should be distinguished from \nclassical Liberals); if you are not Progressive, radical-left-wing, or \nFeminist, you\u0027re a racist, misogynistic homophobe.\n\nAnd note that I\u0027m a mixed-race lesbian saying this.","+Space Marine This is basically the entire point behind this \nvideo-slash-TED talk. It\u0027s a subtle but decisive slam against factions of \npeople who push a breed of totalitarianism disguised as progress of some \nflavor or other, or, as in the case of the most current blatant example: \nOutrage culture and censorship, protected through method of shutting down \nconversation with the adherent catch-all words like sexist / racist / etc. \nNow I know how the conservatives feel to have the bulk of their population \ncomprised of religious and/or militaristic nutbags. It\u0027s embarrassing - \nworse, it\u0027s destructive.","+Space Marine you\u0027re right, you do sound like a paranoid conspiracy \ntheorist.

Historically the strong states were used to \nrepress workers and lower class demands. Speech was a privilege of the rich \nand the important, debtors were put in prison or in slavery. Citizens of \nthe wrong birth would not be allowed to vote, were barred from some \nprofessions or would be parked in reserved space. Oppression is still \npretty much present today and takes new forms. For example corporations are \ngiven equal rights to people, medias are desensitizing and filled with \nunimportant matters, countries and ethnicities are played against each \nothers. The modern tools of oppression embraces the language of freedom as \nif taking from Orwell \"manual\".","+Bombigst There is no libertarian socialism.

When you \nsay, \"people get rich by just collecting as much money as possible without \nreally giving much back\", sounds like the socialist fallacy of surplus \nvalue at work or that you just took misconceptions about wealth for granted \nIMHO, and I\u0027d humbly like to help you with that.\n\nIn the private sector you usually become rich by providing more in value to \nsociety than what people give their money for (otherwise, they\u0027ll just \nstick to their money). So a company actually must help society or it dies a \nquick death. One simple rule you\u0027ll usually see applied to the rich is that \nthey get more money because they often help many more people than you or I \ndo. Sure, you can also get a lot of money if you have a few customers who \nare very rich and pay you a lot, but you\u0027re more likely to make more money \nby helping more people. They may each pay you just a little, but the \naggregate is bigger. Getting rich is not about selfish hoarding because \nit\u0027s not a zero-sum game.\n\nGovernments and central banks are the wealthiest institutions in the world. \nSo explain to me why they always get a free pass on responsibility for \nsocial injustices in the world, while companies that rely on providing \nvalue to society are villified? In fact, the former are hailed as the very \ninstruments of social justice.\n\nIt\u0027s like being a staunch defender of a dictatorship because it has more \npower to do good and fix society. I agree that it might, but we all know \nwhat most dictatorships end up doing.\n\nYour hypothetical about Coca-Cola corrupting research, only shows that \nscientists can be corrupted, and I\u0027d argue just as much by a private \ncompany as by government or a criminal organization. Their results, \nhowever, can\u0027t corrupt the body of human knowledge, because of how science \nand the scientific community works. My point was that there is moral \ncorruption in the very taking of government money. It corrupts the quality, \nchoice, and cost of your work, even if you do important science. Taxpayers \nhave very little choice over how their money is spent.\n\nIf you want a better society, you have to think in terms of incentives. The \nincentive to making good use of money is bigger when you actually have to \nearn it. Government just points a gun at you.\n\nCase in point, Irwin Schiff, a tax protester who argued he should not pay \nthe federal income tax, not as a criminal, but by openly protesting its \nlegality many times in court, has just died a few days ago in prison. \nWhether or not you like taxes, don\u0027t forget to keep paying them.","+danfg okay, I have looked at the article and it is from what I have read \nnot really helping in our discussions. I am not sure if it is an older \narticle but all sources I have checked are from before 2009. Around 2004 - \n05. Which is 10 years ago (and before global financial crisis). \n\nBut to be fair, I haven´t shown you any studies or articles, so yeah. ;)","+danfg Hmm, funny that you bring up companies which try to work around \ntaxes. ;) Anyway, I appreciate that you share your well thought opinions.\n\nBasically you are saying, that states are not capable of using tax money \nright, right? Then we are at least at the same boat. But this is in my \nopinion not a problem of taxes but on how the governments use it. But yeah, \nwe are turning in circles now ;)\n\nYour view on scientific funding though is in my opinion wrong. If a state \ngives money to scientists it is exactly because society values scientific \nprogress and is willing to pay for it. \nAnd company funding can corrupt science in a way that companies can control \nthe fields of research or pay for \"research results\" that show that for \nexample coca cola is healthier than it is. On the other hand there are \nresearchers and scientists working for companies anyway. I just think that \nit is good to know, that not all scientists checking the quality of cola \nare paid by coca cola, pepsi and co.\n\nMy argumentation may indeed be socialist colored. I just think that \nindividuals having lots of money doesn´t necessarily translate into better \nwell being of society. It is not, what I see  in the world. Most people \njust try to collect as much money as possible without really giving much \nback. That is how people get rich, right? \n\nI never said Sweden and Norway are socialist paradises. I just think that \nthere society works very good in comparison to other states. Which comes \nfor example comes from there good education system. But I will read the \nlink you send.","+Thinker There is, USA has been preventing China from accessing the ISS, \nthat\u0027s why China is building it\u0027s own station.","+Stabacs McBass (sorry for the long post) Tell me the name of a country \nwithout a central bank, and I\u0027l tell you where a free market could exist. \nYou\u0027re blaming poverty on a ghost: there are no free markets anywhere, only \nvarying degrees of economic freedom, and prosperity to be found \nproportionally where there\u0027s more of it.\n\nYou can\u0027t solve the problem of poverty by taxing those who have money, \nbecause legitimately rich people attain wealth by giving value to society. \nIf you think Apple doesn\u0027t deserve its vast wealth, give them your Apple \nproducts back (or give Google your Android if that\u0027s the case, and stop \nusing their search engine while you\u0027re at it).\n\nIt is those who take money without directly providing value, through \ntaxation, from rich and poor alike, that are the reason society\u0027s \nwellbeing, future and resources are being destroyed on a massive scale. \nThey\u0027ll tell you it\u0027s for the poor/education/healthcare/etc, but a third \nparty using money obtained through taxes will always tend to spend more of \nit and less wisely.\n\nThe moral corruption of a publicly-funded scientist is in how they get \nfunded, how they think society can\u0027t value scientific progress enough to \npay for it willingly, so they don\u0027t bother doing the work to convince them, \nthey just turn to government. Every company that wants to stay in business \nhas to do marketing. Wouldn\u0027t you consider it an immoral business practice \nif a company created a product they think will change society so they force \npeople by law to pay for it?\n\nNo matter how much a scientist funded by Coca-cola can be morally corrupt, \nyou can\u0027t morally corrupt the scientific knowledge she produces.\n\nYour argumentation seems to come from a socialistic point of view, I think \ndiscussions about taxes must compare how individuals employing their own \nmoney versus the state employing other people\u0027s money translates into more \nwellbeing for society.\n\nIMO, best way to use taxes is to use less of it, because tax money, by \nnature of how it\u0027s obtained, tends to be used less optimally than private \nmoney.\n\nSweden and Norway are not the socialist paradise you think they are: \nhttp://www.bullshitexposed.com/scandinavian-socialism-debunked/","+danfg In my opinion the greed of people combined with free market economy \nis the problem of imbalance in money distribution. But this would lead into \na long conversation about capitalism critique etc, and I wanna stick to the \ntopic. \n\n\nTaxes have to be used the right way. Then they are actually helping with \nquality of life. The best example are countries like sweden and norway. As \nfar as I know they have rather high taxes but also a very high standard of \nliving. \n\n\nAlso, there is a contradiction in you arguments. You say taxes are the \nreason of poverty. But without taxes there is no money for the state to do \nsomething against poverty. Like providing education, good infrastructures \n(for the economy), science fundings (that help after all the economy as \nwell) etc. \n\n\nAlso I don´t see how scientists are \"morally corrupted\" when they take \nmoney from the state. In my opinion they are more morally corrupted when \nthey take money from Coca Cola, L\u0027oreal or McDonald´s.\n\n\nYour argumentation seems to come from an individualistic point of view, but \nI think that discussions about taxes have to come from a point of view that \nhas the well being of the society, mankind and the particular state in mind.\n\n\nBut you are definitely right that taxes have to be used in a good way and \nthere are enough examples in probably every state where some money goes \ninto the wrong projects or pockets.","+Stabacs McBass you might be right thinking it\u0027s stupid not to pay taxes, \nbut you currently don\u0027t have a choice. The percentage of what you earn that \ngoes to taxes should make you feel a lot worse about it, specially if you \nactually work hard, own a company, or take the time to look into how poorly \na huge amount of tax dollars are employed (ISS is just a very minor \nexample). I don\u0027t know what you do for a living, but if you or your family \nare currently living off taxpayer\u0027s money somehow (if you\u0027re an overpaid \npublic servant or getting some kind of welfare) you\u0027ll obviously want the \nfree money to keep flowing. It\u0027s why you see scientists being morally \ncorrupted by public funding, they\u0027ve given up looking for any kind of \nhonest patronage from the private sector, it\u0027s so much more convenient to \nirresponsibly take money from taxpayers. The biggest agent of misallocation \nof resources in the world are states and their taxes. Their policies are \nthe main reason we have so much poverty, lower quality of life than we \nshould have, and overconsumption of natural resources in the world. We are \nabout to have a global economic crisis soon as a result of all this \nrecklessness. I hope that can sum up my beef with taxation for you, but \nI\u0027ll be happy to go into more detail if you\u0027d like. Or, we can just wait \nfor the coming crisis to make my point.","+danfg but the point is: why should I? It is stupid to not pay taxes. At \nleast in a good state. Not the USA, I guess. As they use it for more war \nefforts instead of education or environment protection improvement, right?","+Stabacs McBass try not paying your taxes and see for yourself. If you \nthink violence and intimidation is not in any way involved in collecting \ntaxes, that it\u0027s somehow a completely voluntary endeavor, then I must \ninvite you to come visit planet Earth one of these days and see how things \nare done.","+danfg do they send soldiers? or police officers? Or how do they force you \nto pay through violence? And also: Taxes are useful if spend right? The \nstate needs money to provide education, security, cleaning, maintaining and \nrepairing streets etc etc. And of course to keep science and culture alive.","+Thinker agreed, ISS \u003d great achievement. A marvel of collaboration? Not so \nmuch, IMHO.","+danfg well, that escalated quickly.\n\nWhile I recognize the immorality of forceful seizure of money from the \npopulous, I also recognize the ISS truly is a great scientific achievement \nof humanity; but most of all, I recognize those two are not mutually \nexclusive.\n\nThe ISS is a marvel of human scientific achievement, something like that \nwasn\u0027t even concievable 100 years ago, and the experiments done there will \nbe crucial in humanity\u0027s quest for truth \u0026 exploration.\n\nBut like +Chris Shilts? posted, scientific achievement is not a \njustification for immorality, but that does not explain why immorality \nhappen in the first place. Even without the ISS, the government will still \nburden the people with unfair methods in order to fund itself.\n\nBut its also unfair to solely blame the government for these problems, the \npeople also bear some responsibility for indirectly allowing it to happen, \nalso the budget is not solely used to cover the government\u0027s interests, \nit\u0027s also used for the people\u0027s. If fact, do you know the greatest \nexpenditure of U.S. national budget goes to care for the elderly?\n\nIn other words, the immorality is the responsibility of the government and \nthe people, not the ISS.","+Chris Shilts My original comment was about the irony of the OP hailing the \nISS as a marvel of collaboration, when so much of what made it possible was \nviolence and misappropriation. I have no problem with scientific progress \nor space exploration. I do have a problem with people who can\u0027t see the \nforest for the trees, who are so easily excited by a space station, \nbecause, SCIENCE!, that they can\u0027t afford to be inconvenienced by a moral \nconscience ruining their astronaut fantasy. Call the construction of the \nISS what it is: a stupendous waste of money for a relatively small amount \nof scientific knowledge. Do you want to get all excited about that \n\"invaluable\" science? I\u0027m not stopping you. Just don\u0027t be upset with me for \nexposing the ignorance or deceit of disproportionate praise.","+danfg No, it\u0027s not ok to rob a bank to give to charity. That\u0027s not the \ncomparison I\u0027m making here.\n\nI agree with you about the government getting it\u0027s funds through force. \nIt\u0027s not a good system, and I\u0027d like to change it. But complaining about \nour space programs, which make up less than 1% of the budget, isn\u0027t going \nto stop the forceful seizure of property, or wasted public funds. At best, \nyou\u0027ll help some greedy politicians divert those funds to their pet \nprojects, which give nothing back to humanity.","+Chris Shilts So it\u0027s ok to rob a bank if you give all the money to \ncharity? Morality is not dispensable if you want scientific progress.\n\nHow much are you willing to pay for science? When paying with other \npeople\u0027s money, it\u0027s a slippery slope, very easy to be greedy (\"as much as \nI can\") or careless (\"it\u0027s not hurting anyone\"). What if the ISS had cost \n10 times more than it did? What if it had cost like 100 trillion dollars, \nwould that still be ok?\n\nI don\u0027t even have to multiply the funds by 10 or a 1000 to make it costly, \nit\u0027s a pretty big amount already. If the imorality of it doesn\u0027t bother \nyou, then try to visualize what else that huge amount of money could have \nbeen used for. Right now, you\u0027re only thinking of wars and F-35s.","+danfg Let\u0027s put this into perspective: over a trillion dollars spent on \nthe Iraq / Afghan wars, another Trillion on the F-35 joint strike fighter \nprogram. Both payed for through forceful taxation. I say, if you want to \ndeal with forceful taxation, start with the big ticket items that only seem \nto give humanity more death and destruction.","+danfg It provided a lot of scientific insight","I don\u0027t know how much of the money used to build the ISS came directly from \nthe private sector, but I wouldn\u0027t call it a marvel of collaboration if \nthis massively expensive project was forcefully funded by taxpayers from \ndifferent countries. Handing your wallet to an armed thug is not the best \nmodel of collaboration in my opinion.","+Dennis Liu\nIt is, but it runs acceptably well nonetheless. The tech gets outdated fast.\nOnce the SLS rockets are up and running, we\u0027ll be able to get all sorts of \nstuff and larger space station modules up into earth/moon orbit.","+IchBinEin ISS is already over aged iirc..","+Dennis Liu - Funny thing is, because of this embargo, China is building \ntheir own space station instead, which is scheduled for 2020. \nBecause the US didn\u0027t want China to participate in the global endeavor that \nis ISS, because *\"can\u0027t let them gooks make scary stuff\"*, and perhaps \nbettering their political status and becoming better friends with each \nother, they alienate each other by doing this.

We\u0027re talking about people with \ngreat minds walking out of the wood works to give these lazy fools the \nattention they never deserved.

I agree that religion shouldn\u0027t be tax exempt and the \ngovernment shouldn\u0027t give money to religious institutions. I am hair saying \nthat religion has things the secularists could use. Like a better sense of \ncommunity and self control (not morality). I understand non religious \npeople and smarter and have morality.

It\u0027s \nfunny that you pointed out only one study where religious people have \nbetter results, where there are tons of studies showing that on average \natheists are smarter than christians, atheists are more humanitarian than \nchristians, and so on. And humans have been curious since humans. Your \narguments pro religion\u0027s involvement in education are pointless. I didn\u0027t \nsay that every religious person is bad; I said that people can be good \n(maybe even better) without religion. I agree that religion did good in \nsome parts, but again, those goods could\u0027ve been done without religion. \nAlso, you seem a little smarter than other christians I\u0027ve met. Trust me, \nvery few have your understanding of religion. Most of them just take what \nis given to them with no question. \"If God says so, I\u0027m gonna do it\". And \nthat gives religion too much power. Religion is useless. You can be nice \nand educated without it. And, I\u0027ll give you the credit: Religion made \neducation much better.

Religion did a lot of good. Anything bad from religion was \npolitical. If anything is bad it\u0027s the need for status. That is a result of \nbeing pack animals. We are pack animals. Most humans want to be controlled. \nReligion is not inherently bad. It\u0027s good and a lot of good has come from \nit.

It \nmight be, but not as religion makes him. I have no problem with people \nbelieving that someone out there is looking for them; it is a nice thought. \nBut, when a lot of money are spent on useless buildings, covered in gold, \nwhile there are insufficient medical institutions and schools, it upsets \nme. It\u0027s not your belief that upsets me, it\u0027s the stupid people who use \nthis belief as an excuse to do what they want, and the even more stupid \npeople who believe them. And trust me, education would\u0027ve been ensured even \nwithout religion. It just happened that some religious people were first to \ntake action. And again, I agree with the weapons problem, but let\u0027s face it \nthat religion is a problem as well. If you want to believe in a God, very \nwell. But you can pray to him from home, and you can prove your loyalty by \njust being a nice person. If you consider that you need to spend billions \nof dollars to love your God, you\u0027re mentally challenged. And for fuck\u0027s \nsake, stop kissing icons.

In fact by staying \nreligion is evil that shows you are being controlled by your belief as \nwell. The problem is that we were designed to be part of a tribe and to not \ntrust or like other tribes. Religion at its base is good. The problem is \nlabeling the beliefs as Christian or Muslim.

It definitely is not \nEnglish, but I think it will evolve from English or some post-English \nlanguage.\n\nOther languages have advantages that English  or the \"optimal language\" \nwould/should incorporate. For example, East Asian languages have tonal \nsounds that languages like English do not have which is why it is more \nlikely for an Asian native language speaker to have perfect pitch than a \nEnglish native language speaker to have perfect pitch.","+Enlightenment Actually, I absolutely agree with you. English should be the \nonly language that is being spoken on Earth. Integration, Standartization, \nUnity - Those are the words of the future.","+Philip Jones That\u0027s really a weak argument, what does the human vs brain \nhave to do with programming languages? Programming languages can just as \nlikely be processed by human brains. Computers are proven to be more \nsufficient than human brains in most and soon all activities.","+Enlightenment\nProgramming languages don\u0027t count I\u0027m afraid and despite what you might \nhave been told, they do not compare just as the computer/brain comparisons \ndon\u0027t stand up.","+Mounir Baroudi Well I was referring to human languages, I am proficient in \nabout 16 programming languages (started programming since the age of 11). I \nam also currently taking my masters in mathematics. I\u0027ve only looked up to \ndead people, hence have never felt the urge to communicate with lower ones.","+Liam Thongvilu Learning Mathematics and Computer Coding Languages are \nlanguages in their own right too!","+Enlightenment I know quite a few people who speak several languages \nfluently. Its a fact of life for MOST people in the world. Being able to \nspeak only one language is the exception rather than the rule. Learning \nanother language for the sake of it is beneficial but unless you immerse \nyourself in that country/culture then you lose most of the benefit because \nyou never get the thinking strategies that helped the language evolve. \n\nOf course if you grew up in an environment where people speak several \nlanguages then you are not capable of understanding the advantages it gives \nyou. As for English being the only language needed then I beg to differ. \nDifferent languages express ideas differently and its a very good \ntranslator that can convey the full sense of anything that is written. If \nyou are indeed multilingual then you will appreciate that.","+Enlightenment it\u0027s ironic how you have chosen to name your internet alias, \nconsidering how little you actually know about life. I know your type. I \ntraversed that phase myself. You talk as though intellectual pursuits are \nobjectively meaningful and all else is not. I encourage everyone to chase \nwhat really moves them. The quest for knowledge seems to move you. But know \nthat eventually all things end-- your life, all that you have learned, all \nthat you have created, and all that humanity has ever created. So don\u0027t \ncome in here touting your bullshit as if there is some importance behind it \nother than your subjective values.","I\u0027m learning Japanese at university because i like Japanese music and \nJapanese culture :) ","Ivan, Enlightenment, I agree with both of you two, and I\u0027m not sure why you \ntwo are arguing :S\n\nEnlightenment argues that learning a language is a waste of time, which is \nindeed true for his personal lifestyle.\nIt\u0027s VERY useful to speak another language, but only if you actually have a \nneed for it. Languages are a tool that you USE. Tools you use to explore \nother cultures, obtain information from unique sources, and basically break \ngates into endless more possibilities.\n\nBut if you don\u0027t need that tool? Then you\u0027ll never use it. You\u0027ll \neventually throw it in your garage until you forget about it","+One way Ticket Nah, I am freakin\u0027 awesome. Also on the contrary it is you \nwho are lame, that\u0027s why learning new languages will only expose myself to \nmore proles rubbish.","+Enlightenment you are lame.","+Ivan Chagas Never mind, your opinions are worthless. People of the proles \nclass wouldn\u0027t get it.","+Enlightenment For someone whose nickname is \"Enlightenment\" you really \nsurprised me hahaha\n1) It\u0027s funny how you call others degenerates for reading blogs and \nwatching movies, but you\u0027re doing so on a comedy YouTube channel. Besides, \nblogs can be about studying and something work-related. And movies (I mean \nfilms in general) can be documentaries. And even funnier is how you point \nother people out without compassion. Isn\u0027t that what Enlightenment is about?\n2) Yes, there are people who learn languages to befriend others. And so \nwhat? If it makes their lives better, they will be more productive and \nhappier. Not everybody functions the same way. Some people need more \nentertainment than others. Some people just need an ice cream. Some, an \nafternoon running in the park.\n3) You call it a waste of time, but you have to know that \"waste of time\" \nis defined by the one who\u0027s doing the action, not by those who are \nobserving it. If the last case was true, I\u0027d define that you commenting is \na waste of time; thus, you would be a hypocrite.\n4) Not everything that matters is translated, it\u0027s a falacy. You assume \nthat it is. But for something to be translated, it has to be important \nfirst. Thus, there are things that are important and not yet translated. \nAnd, who defines that something needs to be translated? There are so many \nstages. And try studying philosophy, arts or psychology, to name a few, \nwithout reading the originals. Of course you can get by, but you will miss \nsome much of it. There are actual classes just to discuss the originals and \nwhat the author meant.\nI don\u0027t mean to sound rude, or condescending, or arrogant, but you raised \nvery shallow points. I understand your rage against people who do it for \nthe sake of social status or for making friends, but who created an \nuniversal and unique goal for learning languages? You may do it for \nwhatever reason you have. If I want to spend 8 years learning a language to \nwrite just one line of text, that\u0027s fine! It\u0027s up to me to decide if it\u0027s \nworth it or not. You see my point?","+Ivan Chagas I speak three languages, I haven\u0027t found anything unique in \nterms of academic papers, if something is really important it\u0027s going to \nget translated anyhow into our \"standard language\"/English. Blogs and \nmovies are meant for degenerates. English is the only language we really \nneed, honestly. Cultures are shared by a group of narrow-minded people that \nall share the same opinions and mindset  which is often if not always \ncorrelated to religion (bleh). They talk in terms of \"we\" instead of \"I\", \nbiggots. I agree about the work part, I like to generalize my opinions and \nthe only proposition you\u0027ve convinced me of is something as superficial as \n\"work\". Unless if it is something academically beneficiary such as studying \ndifferent linguistic structures and so on... Most of you study it to \nbefriend others and chit-chat. Not to mention, waste of time; claiming you \nknow a language but have only grasped the most basic fundamentals  their \nlevel is synonymous with street slugs yet they claim to be fluent; what a \njoke.","+Enlightenment That\u0027s very, very reductionist of you.\nI learn languages so I have access to more sources of knowledge. There is a \nlarge amount of articles, academic papers, blogs and courses in other \nlanguages. And that\u0027s just another side of it. English is 50% of internet, \n20% of books, 40% of scholarly journals, 30% of movies.\nThere are many more, like emerging in a new culture, being able to read \ncontent in their originals - and that\u0027s crucial, depending on your job - , \netc. :-)\nSo, I take into account that you don\u0027t want or don\u0027t see a purpose, but \njust because you don\u0027t, it doesn\u0027t mean that there isn\u0027t one. ","+Liam Thongvilu What\u0027s the point in learning a new language? I don\u0027t \ncommunicate with anyone anyhow. Why should I want to learn a complete new \nlanguage, just to chit-chat? Seems pretty foolish to me.","+Ivan Chagas that\u0027s awesome, my 5th is on the way too :)","+Liam Thongvilu I was going to say that! :-) Currently, I\u0027m learning my \nsixth language","+TexasRedneck I\u0027ve had this mammoth in the freezer that I\u0027ve been trying to \ndevour but it\u0027s taking forever to get through.

Yet, in spite of its richness, it is easy to construct and explore.\n\nFor those who like a challenge, I suggest trying to find ways to:\n\n(a) construct a row directly without constructing the rows above it;\n\n(b) find formulae for the numbers in the \"spine\" (1, 2, 6, 20, 70, 252, \n...) and the adjacent columns (1, 3, 10, 35, 126, 462, ...);\n\n(c) find formulae for some of the diagonals (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...; 1, \n4, 10, 20, 35, ...; etc.).\n\nPerhaps you could also try constructing and exploring alternative additive \ntriangles, such as, for example:\n\nRow 0 0 1 1\nRow 1 0 1 2 0 \nRow 2 0 .1. 3 2 0\nRow 3 0 1 4 .5. 2 0\nRow 4 0 1 5 9 7 .2. 0\nRow 5 0 1 6 12 16 9 2 .0.\n\nAre those the squares I see?

Human threat VS Non-human threat?\n1a- it is a human threat \n1b- it is a non human threat\n\n\n1a-does the human threat posses a weapon (rock, stick, spear, sling, bow, \ngun)\n1b-what type of non human threat is it? (air, land, big, small, fast, slow)\n\n\nNow, im not saying that Prairie dogs actually have distinct words for \ndescribing the types of weapons... but due to the variety of threats they \nface, they may infact have calls that describe those threats with more \ndetail and of course more variation. (ie: air, land, above ground, \nunderground, fast, slow, big, small or position in relation, size and \nshape, make and model). lol if they used tools we could even consider them \nnatures mechanics (/cheesy joke)","+Shawn Ravenfire Prairie dogs might have naturally evolved with a ord for \n\"gun\" *after* guns were invented.

Youre right Lorie ??","+lauroflorin nice to meet you too","+gavin kemp hahaha ass talking, you\u0027re not doing this for a living / as a \nhobby, your opinion has no value","+Lorie Franceschi first of yes we can learn a language without knowing the \nstructure. other wise it would have been impossible to learn a language let \nalone learn an other or learn a tribal language separated from us for \nthousands of years only the american Indians learnt Spanish to communicate.\n\nsecond as I said to be able to tame an animal we had to understand its \nsociety and thus its manner of communication. what is more for this video \nto have been made the research you claim doesn\u0027t exist must have been done. \nextensive research on how cetaceans communicate, chimps .. has been done \ncheck wikipedia. we hear more of the animal that have learnt a simplist \nform of our langage because we can equate to it and that it is arguable \nmore impressive but to simply pull out this feat we had to know how the \nchimp communicated so we could teach them sign language.","+gavin kemp This is the problem: When humans study ways that other animals \ncommunicate, we are trying to determine if their language matches ours. It \ndoes not, even a child knows this is true. What we need to do is learn how \nother animals communicate with each other before we can determine whether \nor not they have a language that is similar to what humans have as a \nlanguage. \nWhen humans learn a second language, they must learn how a sentence is \nstructured before they can really communicate fluently in that language. \nDogs bark, we as humans think we know what some of those barks mean through \nobservation, yet we are not 100% sure. Until we learn another animals \nlanguage, we will never know if they have a language structure like our \nown. \n\nWe cannot judge other animals by our standards. the few animals that we do \ncommunicate with have learned our language whether it is through symbols, \nsigning, or short one or two word commands. We have not learned their form \nof language. When we do learn an other animal\u0027s language then we can judge \nif they have a language like ours.","+Lorie Franceschi sorry for somereason your commebt didn\u0027t appear. \n\nMy point of aave is that is a real case of ethnocentrism. It has been jugde \nas infereor because it not normal english ie no fact.\n\nWith animal communication he has given variables with which to compare \ncommunication methodes. It is done with measured facts.\n\nHumans also have a form \"animal\" communication. That is how when two \nhumains meet they communicate with simple jestures. Recognising emotions is \nuniversal amongs humans. It is instinctive. With thus form of communication \nwe perform basic communication and begin teaching each other your language \nbut can\u0027t do abstract concepts. \n\nI also disagree that we haven\u0027t done the effort to learn animal language. \nA) this video proves that extentive research has been done. B) there are \npeople who have made an effort to communicate with animals that is after \nall we had to understand animal communication to tame social animals.\n\nThe thing is ethnocentrism isn\u0027t a scientific concept. Science measure \nfact. Ethnocentrisme is a concept to create conflict. \n\nIs it ethnocentricity if they are right.","+lauroflorin Thank you. it is difficult for humans to realize that they may \nnot be the smartest animal on the planet.","Svitri Magnusson\nlanguage is biological? ahahahahah\ndo raise up a kid away from society and see then if language is biological","+Lorie Franceschi Yes, your hunches are correct, most humans are \nanthropocentric and most researches are ethnocentric, and the beginning of \nthis video shows this. There are, of course more open minded people that \naccept that we\u0027re not that special, but ego-crushing takes a lot of \nstrength.\n\nSome other things worth mentioning are, from what I researched so far, it \nwas NEVER a human learning the language (I am using the term language as \nthe form of communication, not as humans have defined it) of the non-human \nanimal, it was the other way around, because US HUMANS could not initiate a \nconversation otherwise (e.g. Koko the gorilla having to learn sign \nlanguage, Alex the parrot having to learn english, Kanzi the bonobo \nlearning lexigrams, etc.).\nWhat does this tell about humans compared to non-humans?","+gavin kemp You just agreed with my point. Ethnocentrism in this case, is \nthe judging of other animals based on human values and culture especially \nlanguage. We do not know enough to be able to judge other animals as to \nwhether they have a language or not. Your statement that AAVE has \ngrammatical structures that English does not have, is the prefect example \nof what I have been saying all along. We had to learn AAVE to be able to \nunderstand its grammatical structure. \n\n\"Click language\" of the San Bushmen is so different from almost all other \nlanguages that humans speak. Some one from the tribe learned another \nlanguage so that he could teach his native language to other humans. \n\"civilized\" human cultures at first thought these bushmen were not \ncommunicating in a language that had a grammatical structure. We had to \nlearn this form of communicating before we could study it an find the \ngrammatical structure. \n\nThe same thing is happening in this video. We do not know how to \ncommunicate in avian, ursidae, canine or feline, to name a few, to be able \nto determine if they have a grammatical structure. Because we do not know \nhow to communicate with other animals, we are judging their communication \nby human standards which is ethnocentrism (judging other groups by human \nvalues and culture especially language by human standards. \n\nWhen we finally learn to communicate in another animals style, will be able \nto determine if it has a grammatical structure. Then and only then will be \nable to say if the other animals have language or not.","+Lorie Franceschi no. my point that it is not ethnocentrism because with \nthe number of studies it should be good science. ethnocentrism is more or \nless saying \"my way of doing is superior because it is\". saying AAVE is \ninferior to english because its not good english is ethnocentrism (in fact \nAAVE has very interesting gramatical structures absent in english). saying \nmy methode of production is better than yours because I yield twice as much \nis fact. here we have made a comparison with facts. Yes, we\u0027ve defined \nlanguage as top humain communication but it is done by comparing facts.\n\nas far as i can tell animal communication is instinctive and almost \nuniversal (their are different dialect apparently). humains have a similar \ncommunication method, we are capable of understanding instinctively the \nemotions of someone even if they are on the other end of the planet.\na language is a complexe set of rules that have 4 criteria and which are \nnot universal.","+gavin kemp So, you are agreeing with me that this is not good science? I \nam easily confused when i am tired which I am at this point in time. so \nplease explain. Thank You","+Lorie Franceschi yes i checked that up.\nbut as you pointed out that good science ignores ethnocentrism, thus my \npoint. ","+gavin kemp this came from google when I typed in ethnosentrism:\n\n\neth·no·cen·trism\n\n?eTHn??sentriz?m/\n\nnoun\nnoun: ethnocentrism\n\n\n\n\nevaluation of other cultures according to preconceptions originating in the \nstandards and customs of one\u0027s own culture.\nSaying other animals do not have language, is saying that by our standards \nas humans, they don\u0027t have a language, which you are then using \nethnocentrism to plead your case, which does not carry any weight.","+Lorie Franceschi \nI\u0027m not sure it is ethnocentrism, there are plenty of comparisons to other \nspecies.\nand any way how do you use ethnocentrism to prove anything.\n\ni\u0027ll add that making a mistake in a publication can be dramatic. there was \na top scientist in france who spoke about homeothapie, he didn\u0027t lose his \nphd but he was ridiculed to the extreme","+gavin kemp when a society such as when humans study another animal\u0027s \nsociety and try to place their (human) values (culture, language, morals or \nanything else) it is called ethnocentrism. When humans say that other \nanimals do not have language, they using ethnocentrism to try to prove they \nare correct. Scientists with half a brain know that they have to be very \ncareful not to do this. \n\nbut of course, the ones in the ivory towers are just worried about NOT \nloosing their PhD status and will publish anything even if it retracted \nlater... Publsh , publish , publish or perish.","+Lorie Franceschi just to counter this argument, several bird can do an \nimpresive veriate of sounds right down to thing like, chain saws or various \ncamera so its not just vocal cords or our mouth. \n\n\nsecond are you sure that we haven\u0027t tried to understand their language. i \nmean jut to make this video means that we have studied the way they\u0027re \ncommunication works.\n\n\nI think the point of language is that its a communication tool with no real \nlimites and for that you need at least the four rules defined.\n\n\nyour point on civilization is problematic because civilized is also viewed \nas a value and not jut as state. by the definition of civilized, the great \ncities of mezoptamia weren\u0027t civilized they didn\u0027t have a writing system. a \nsmall tribe wouldn\u0027t be concidered civilized because it didn\u0027t have urban \ndevellopment or domination of the natural environment.\n\n\nthing get confusing when we get connotation on old words. barbarian is a \nnegative word initially it meant stranger.","+Eucalyptus Dreadlord cool","+Lorie Franceschi Fair enough?","Leave the troll alone...","+Eucalyptus Dreadlord Then stop putting human standards on other animals. \nthey don\u0027t all have vocal cords like we do, yet we know they communicate.","+Lorie Franceschi It\u0027s like antennae. Antennae is defined as appendages \nfound on insects, crustaceans, and certain Arthropods. Technically, it\u0027s \nnot even possible for humans to have antennae, even if they have an \nappendage exactly like one. That\u0027s what I\u0027m getting at.","+Lorie Franceschi you\u0027re falling in the same mistake you\u0027re pointing out, \nyou criticize that we \"impose\" our human language as a standard, but you \nstill think that other animals have the same human concepts-significances \nembedded in their \"own language\"\n\nthere are two things to notice: \n1) the signs and significances we have are a historical achievement and \nthey are absolutely arbitrary, so animals don\u0027t have them \"in their own \nway\" is not like comparing english and spanish (there\u0027s a lot more to go \non, but i would make a mess trying to make myself understood)\n2) the other thing is, as you say, we \"can\u0027t\" comprehend what other animals \ncommunicate between one and other just like they comprehend between \nthemselves, but you have to remember the simplest definition of \ninformation, which is \"order, or patterns\", that\u0027s how we know that bees \ncommunicate things about distances and quality of food, because we note and \ndecipher their patterns.","+Svitri Magnusson You don\u0027t know if other animals have the same thing as we \ndo. There is know way you can know that. No one in history the of huminids \ninteracting with other animals, has been able to decipher another animal\u0027s \nlanguage. You are putting HUMAN values on other animals. It just does not \nwork. \n\nAlso, we have four appendages, just like almost (i am saying almost not \nevery) every other higher life form on our tiny blue planet\n\nThe capacity to make noise is biological in some form or another in most \nanimals. Humans have what we consider language by our reasoning. We do not \nknow if other animals have that capacity or not, because we do not 1) no \ntheir way of communicating and 2) if we do know they are communicating, we \ndo not know how they are doing it. i.e.; we know bees do a dance that tells \nthe hive where there is nectar, what we don\u0027t know is how the bees \ninterpret that information. they could be saying, \"remember that big sun \nflower where we got all that nectar yesterday, well go another 50 yards and \nthere is a huge field of flowers.\" We don\u0027t know that and can not know it \nuntil we learn their way of communicating. \n\nWe know how our languages work, but we do not know how other animals\u0027 \nlanguages work, because we can not speak in other animals tongues. \n\nJust because animals can use language in our way, does not mean they don\u0027t \nhave their own.","+Lorie Franceschi\nAgain, you are meshing language and communication. Language is a BIOLOGICAL \nPROPERTY THAT HUMANS HAVE.\nJust like we have two arms and dogs have four legs. The capacity for \nlanguage is biological not some \"human value\".","+Eucalyptus Dreadlord\nwhich is why this video is so wrong...they are putting human values on \nother animals.  until we learn to communicate with another animal not human \nin their style of language we can not know if they have a language that \nresembles ours. at this point in history, we can only communicate with \nother animals through simple sounds and signals, not complete HUMAN \nsentenecs.","+Lorie Franceschi Language is a human-defined word, and follows its human \ndefinition(s). Imprecise, vague, abstract, interpretive, and fundamentally \nflawed. Base the judgment on the definitionnot the possibility of a new \none that may help create new categories.","+Peter Thomas You are still putting a human face on whether animals have \nlanguage or not. I will agree that according to human languages they do \nnot,, but you just can not say that animals do not have language. DO YOU \nSPEAK ANY ANIMAL LANGUAGE BUT HUMAN?

We can teach other primates and \ncetaceans who to do basic communication skills, but they are learning our \nlanguage not us learning theirs. Do not put our way of thinking on any \nsubject on to any animal besides our own species.

It\u0027s a philosophical problem, not a linguistic \none.","+Merto6 Looking at the more fundamental mathematical element rather than \nthe superficial sensory element, it needs to be understood that all human \nlanguage consists of a finite set of symbols in sequence. A more advanced \nalien language would probably have \"infinite\" information conveyed in an \ninstant, building a sentence with detail in a single symbol rather than \naccumulated over time. Look back at the actual video, it said nothing about \nthe sensory aspects as that is not what defines language.","+Blinky Lass Thanks, I liked reading it.","Try explaining color to a person who was born blond and has never seen \ncolor. You might try and say that a color like red is a \"hot\" color but, \nblind people will not understand the construct of a color since they so not \nassimilate a descriptive word like \"hot\" to anything visual. We assimilate \nheat with red because fire produce heat and fire is red but blind people do \nnot know this. With human language you cannot explain anything related to a \nsense if the person you are communicating with has not experienced it( try \nexplaining a cat\u0027s meow to a deaf person). A superior language will be able \nto surpass this human language limitation.","+Victor Anzala nice thought, I imagine it would be very pleasureable and \nsocial bonding with this kind of information would prove extremely \nbeneficial.","+Blinky Lass Fascinating read","+Merto6 language is very limiting. Did you ever had a problem to describe a \nfeeling, a emotion, a smell, a taste or other experiences? And language can \nlead to misunderstandings quite fast. Communication can fail even when the \nscenario was perfectly fine.","Let\u0027s look at some quirks and limitations in human language and see how we \ncan work out a picture.\n\n1. Intentionality. We humans are generally limited to fifth-order \nintentionality. At first-order intentionality, an animal is self-aware (\u0027X \nknows that X knows\u0027). At second-order intentionality, an animal is able to \ninfer the thoughts of another (\u0027X thinks that Y knows\u0027). At third-order \nintentionality, an animal is able to lie intentionally and communicate to \nchange another animal\u0027s thoughts about it (\u0027X thinks that Y thinks X \nknows\u0027). Fourth-order intentionality and beyond, often found in literature, \ncan start to tax a human\u0027s mind.\n\nAn alien with more brain power could go beyond. The implication then is \nthat this alien society would be highly interconnected, since they would be \ncapable of managing long chains in a huge relationship web (e.g. \u0027Alice \nguesses that Bob knows that Carrol thinks that Denise doesn\u0027t care that \nElaine suspects that Frank is lying to George\u0027). Such a society would be \nable to grow huge without everyone becoming strangers as in human society.\n\n2. Phonology is more generative than required in human language. What this \nmeans is that any random arrangements of possible sounds or their sign \nequivalents in human language almost always result in non-words; we only \nmake use of a very small subset of possible combinations as real words.\n\nA highly intelligent alien species could probably do amazing things with \nthat extra generativity. It might allow them to bypass the problem of \nlimited time and memory by binding long strings to nonwords, similar to \nwhat we do in programming, binding values to variables and groups of \nstatements to functions. Humans are able to do this to a limited extent in \nwriting, but it is error-prone and doesn\u0027t come naturally. A more advanced \nalien could take this to the next level.\n\n3. Human language is very lossy and makes up for it in redundancy. It\u0027s a \ngeneralized broadcast system that is also supposed to work in noisy \nenvironments. The result is that it doesn\u0027t perform particularly well \neither as a pure broadcast system or a private communications system. \nSpeaking to a roomful of people requires a loud voice and good acoustics, \nwhile trying to talk privately can also be tricky. Whispering and furtive \nsigns are easily misunderstood, but increasing the signal risks others \noverhearing.\n\nAn alien communication system may have more sensitive organs or more \npowerful filtering systems to allow for more compressed messages. It may \nalso specialize so that broadcast communication is fundamentally \ndifferentiated from private communication. Encryption and decryption might \neven be part of an alien communication system.\n\n4. Discreteness. Human language is theoretically discrete, but speech and \nsigns are largely continuous signals that have to be parsed and recreated \nby every listener. An alien communication system may be highly discrete. \nThis may reduce listener-based errors that accumulate in human language and \neliminate a factor in rapid language change.\n\nWith sufficient compression of the source message and little room for fuzzy \ninterpretation, the hypothetical alien language may stay stable for a very \nlong time, unlike human language, which can turn unrecognizable within a \nmillennium.","+Merto6 Something we can\u0027t quite comprehend?","+Merto6 Maybe the final step is that there is no communication, only one \nshared mind among many creatures.","any number of things, biolumenescence, pheromones, telepathy and those are \njust examples I pulled from Mass Effect","telepathy accordingly to many alien abductees","+Julliete Blackwood (The Blue Mermaid) Why just colour?

Anyway, it does serve a purpose: it allows for more \ntypes of agreement, allowing for more redundancy, meaning less information \nis lost when the signal to noise ratio increases due to, say, strong winds, \ncrowds, etc. It also allows more Precision, which is useful in, say, legal \ncontexts (if they had much use for standard pronouns in the first place, \nthat is.) Basically, there is a difference, for all that it\u0027s purely \ngrammatical, not semantic, and it is useful. I\u0027ll grant it\u0027s not Necessary \nthough.","+Laurence Fraser * \"I too have eaten pizza\" or \"I ate some too\"","+Rudy_Eila english \"came from german\" so long ago as to be meaningless. \nThey\u0027re both Germanic and came from the same source, but one didn\u0027t come \nfrom the other, and they\u0027ve both changed a lot due to other things in \nbetween. \"I too\" is valid in English as \"I too would like pizza\" (may \nrequire punctuation, and we\u0027d typically say \"I\u0027d like one too\"), but as an \ninterjection \"i too\" isn\u0027t even a thing.","+Laurence Fraser Yeah I would say \"so do I\" sometimes. Also, English \noriginated from German, and in German you\u0027d actually say \"I too\" not \"me \ntoo.\"\n\nIn any case, I did google this question, and in certain cases it\u0027s actually \ncorrect to say \"I too,\" not \"me too,\" but we still say \"me too\" although \nit\u0027s grammatically incorrect.  ","Partly: \"me too\" is something of an interjection, much like \"yes\" or \"no\" \nin isolation, so they partly ignore everything else and just do their own \nthing. I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s more to it than that though. \"I too\" doesn\u0027t \nwork mostly because it leaves the listener expecting a verb, which causes \nconfusion. \"Me too\" doesn\u0027t.

The ending of the blood \nentertainment spectacle in the Coliseum in late antiquity was also \nTheologically motivated. The destruction of the Temple ruins of Palmyra and \nthe beheading of the chief archaeologist were motivated by the theology of \nIslam, a much more politically motivated religion than Christianity.","+CHAS1422 Google christianity/christendom.

In late \nantiquity it clearly was for theological reasons that they shut down the \nOlympic games, they closed the academy of Athens and sent the philosophers \ninto exile (Haran in Edessa is where they were believed to have ended), and \nthey murdered of Hypatia. The Christian desecration of the classical \ncivilization and the Barbarian invasions were largely responsible for the \nemergence of the dark ages. The Renaissance and the age of enlightenment \nwere periods of rebellion against church authority, and in some respects \nchanges in the theology of Christianity and how it was viewed.

Indeed the natives \nwere treated poorly but never was there an open ended effort to exterminate \nthem. After 1910 the reservation treaties held fast and the Native \nAmericans occupy some of the most pristine tax exempt land in the US, about \n4x the size of Israel The population is about the same as when it was \nlocated by the Europeans.","+CHAS1422 \u003e.\u003e Catholicism, which was the only brand of Christianity at the \ntime, was a government.

Worse that they \ncan\u0027t see the difference between one religious institution and another. \nSeriously it\u0027s like saying Sweden is responsible for exterminating native \nAmericans because the US and Sweden are both Democracies.","+Joseph Ang History must always be taught in absolute truths. Patriarch \nCyril and his Lackey Peter, along with a mob of Christians were responsible \nfor the death of Hypatia, (daughter of Theon), and there is no question \namong historians . Theophilus, mentor of Cyril, burned the Seripium to the \nground in a show of Christian dominion a decade earlier. Orestes, the last \nof the secular governors of Alexandria, was deposed and exiled soon after \nthe death of his friend Hypatia. The library had no protection and was lost \nin history after these events. All literary focus after Christian hegemony \nwas established in Alexandria at the beginning of the 5th century was \nTheological drivel. These events were almost 200 years prior to the blood \nand devastation wrought by the invading Muslims. I doubt the 4th century \nChristians had any respect for preserving pagan works on geometry, or \nneoplatonism. Christianity is best when it submits to secular laws and \nsecular science. It is worst when theological laws and education are the \nlaws of the land.","+Joseph Ang So what, religion still sucks.

Well that is what I heard, but I\u0027m a 21 yo bodybuilder and \ntake propecia and I\u0027m completely healthy, it has not affected me in any \nway, side effects of DHT inhibiting drugs are very very rare (less than 2% \nfind side effects), also the effect of propecia in improving hair density \ndoesn\u0027t last longer than 5-6 years as the body adapts to the blocking of \nDHT, most people won\u0027t use it for a life time.","+SuperResistant if you\u0027ve been taking it for a prolonged period of time \nwith no negative side effects, you\u0027re most likely in the category of people \nwho won\u0027t experience negative issues, your sex drive would most likely not \nbe any different if you weren\u0027t on it. The percentage of people who do get \nnegative side effects (loss of sexual desire and erectile dysfunction are \nonly a few) is debatable but it is much higher than the listed number, in \nmore severe cases the genital tissue has been effected due to the failure \nof regulatory maintenance functions that DHT provides to the genitals and \nprostate and people have started showing symptoms of Peyronie\u0027s Disease \n(bending of the penis tissue) as well as skin deformations on the genitals.","+Time Traveler no use in the human body? did you even read up on DHT before \nposting your comment?

It\u0027s all in how you perceive \nthe world, and everything around you.\nYou most likely have a view on the world, in which you, as a human, \"own\" \neveryhting. Everything, including animals and plants, are for you to \nmanipulate in any way, shape or form, without repurcussions. You make it \nsound like the animals and plants that we have bred through countless \ngenerations, to suit our needs (optimize meat/milk/fruit production), are \nindebted to us, when you say \"[...] in fact if not for the domestication, \nchickens, cows and many vegetables would not even exist in this form, they \nare the result of human intervention...\"\nDo you honestly think that domesticated animals are grateful towards \nhumans, for being forcefully bred to optimize *our* needs?\nI strongly disagree with your point of view, and i hope that more people \nare able to see domesticated animals, used for food, as more than simple \norganism, unable of cognetive thinking.\nI love meat, but i make it a point, to make sure every animal i eat, has \nbeen treated with respect. Animals used in food production are thinking \norganisms, capable of more than a lot of people give them credit for. \nTherefore they should be treated as such. With respect.\nIn my optics, we are merely \"borrowing\" the animals from nature as a whole, \nso the least we can do is to treat them with the respect they deserve.","+IchBinEin Think you need to open your mind a bit, some animals like \nchickens and cows were domesticated to be used for food (milk, meat, eggs), \njust as corn, potatoes and many vegetables are edible due to domestication, \nin fact if not for the domestication, chickens, cows and many vegetables \nwould not even exist in this form, they are the result of human \nintervention, mind you, some animals are not domesticated for food, like \ndogs, they evolved with humans to be used as guards or assist in other \nthings, for the exchange of having guaranteed food from their owners. On \nthe other hand some animals are not even domesticated and not suitable at \nall as a source of food, like dolphins. There\u0027s no harm in eating chicken \nor potatoes, but it\u0027s certainly not the same for many wild animals AND wild \nplants, including dolphins. I\u0027m emphasizing on plants here so you \n(hopefully) realize there\u0027s no difference between plants and animals, \nthey\u0027re both organisms which can be adopted to be used as a source of food \nand other uses for humans.","+dhodz hoddy Wow, someone is a dick","+IchBinEin why don\u0027t you shut the fuck up about how it\u0027s morally superior \nfor the Japs to poach dolphins and get back to raping Nanking and then \ndenying it because that\u0027s what you people find \"honor\" in.","+TheGreenTuxedo Brilliant response to demonstrate your hypocrisy and lack \nof argumentation.","+IchBinEin Um just because they don\u0027t mention pigs doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t \ncare about them.

While they seem to define \n\"shredding\" as a playing style embodied by Dimebag Darrell, Kerry King and \nYngwie Malmsteen, they don\u0027t define the style itself. Jimmy Page could \nshred, Jimi Hendrix did pretty much nothing but shred, and Kurt Cobain was \nknown for shredding the hell out of his guitar when he wasn\u0027t playing \nsomething slower or something more sugary. Sure Hendrix and Cobain didn\u0027t \nreally employ sweep picking or 64th notes at 3000 bpm, but that\u0027s not all \nshredding is. People seem to forget that \"guitar shredding\" has been around \nsince the 70s. It is literally defined as playing a distinctive lead style \nvery well. Even B.B. King could shred, and he played like ten notes a \nminute. lol\n\nGiven all of the science and physics you went into here, with nodes, wave \ncompression, overtones and the like, I\u0027m surprised at how quickly you \nglossed over electric guitars.

I just came around the term as a \ntechnique not just, as you said, playing a distinctive lead style well.","+Bence Joo YOU misunderstand the term \"shred\". It\u0027s not all wails and \nscales. B.B King could shred, as can Ace Frehley. It\u0027s a very very broad \nterm that didn\u0027t take on its present meaning until metal began employing \nsweeps and the like.

Most lucratively successful products/people are \nnot coming from a genuine place. Name any billion dollar industry, or 80% \nof millionaire successes and i\u0027ll cite the 100 people they screwed over and \nthe 100,000 people they ripped off, undercut, or flat out lied to on their \nladder up. Lol...do you really think people care about you? that\u0027s cute :).","+Kris Wingfield Yes, but that doesn\u0027t make him a skilled guitarist, because \nhe wasn\u0027t. So it is just illogical to cite Coban as a \"shredder\". He was \nmuch more a singer/lyricist than he was a musician.","+Donovan Deans If it\u0027s genuine and people like it, it succeeds.","+Kris Wingfield As much as I hate Nickelback, ironically even their \ncompositions on average have the same or more complexity than any Nirvana \nsong. Kurt Cobain never \u0027shred\u0027 in any sense of the word, he screamed and \nrasped while smashing the same cookie cutter power chords. He made millions \nbecause of #1: their image. #2: their message for that generation (for 90\u0027s \nteens/young rebellious adults it was right place right time). I dig \nNirvana, and agree his sort of unique/raspy apathetic lyrics was like the \noriginal voice of grunge right next to Chris Cornell...but it had nothing \nto do with his skill. Fuck, most successful band guitar players are far \nfrom virtuosos or even close to \u0027complete\u0027 as far as the instruments \npotential. People don\u0027t give a shit about that, only how you make them \nfeel. Who the fuck cares anyway, no one\u0027s deragatory opinion is going to \nchange their success, in real life the hardest working people are not \nalways the most rewarded, it is usually the most opportunistic. If that \nsounds unfair, tough shit that\u0027s reality, you don\u0027t need to be a genius to \nget ahead, just a really good idea that\u0027s in demand that you can market to \neveryone.... also, did you really ask if he could play Something in the \nWay, you know that song has literally 2 chords, in a drop tuning, I could \nteach a 5 year old to play that in 5 seconds on two fingers or less, minus \nthe singing LOL.","+Kris Wingfield  First, a trained monkey could play any Nirvana song. \nSecond, the whole \"Let\u0027s see YOU do better!\" argument is for 5-year-olds. \nIt takes zero effort or skill to be a critic of something. But for all you \nknow, he could be an infinitely better guitarist than Cobain. Third, you \ncould make millions filming yourself shitting into a bucket if enough \npeople like it, that doesn\u0027t make you talented.","+Kris Wingfield Wow, you are unnecessarily full of hatred!","+Kris Wingfield\nDude, I\u0027m not hating on him or anything like that, in fact I like much of \ntheir stuff. The fact is he was not a shredder, he just played basic stuff.\n\nShredding is most of the time associated with good technique, fast playing, \nso essentially a certain level of virtuosity.","+Kris Wingfield i like Cobain\u0027s music, but i don\u0027t at all like the guitar \nin it. That doesn\u0027t mean its bad guitar. I\u0027m just more accustomed to jazz \nguitar that i feel like its missing potential.","+Character994 And yet he made millions while \"barely\" holding that \ninstrument. How much have you made with your guitar abilities? Can you even \nplay a Nirvana song all the way through? Besides \"Polly\" or \"Something in \nthe Way\". And when I say \"play\" I mean play. Don\u0027t just gloss over the \nchords and call it a song. This isn\u0027t Nickelback. Rip your heart from your \nchest and beat a song out of your guitar with it. That\u0027s how Kurt played.","+Zappandy\ntotally right. I fully agree. It\u0027s subjective.","+Uli Uchu That\u0027s subjective, I personally find his sound appealing but that \npopularized the whole dirty sound in music. I can listen to that, heck I \nlove that but perhaps I have a bit of a bias against it because more \nguitarists have become a bit lazy when it comes to musicianship. There \nseems to be a higher interest in being a cool rock guitarist ala Hendrix. \n\nFor the record, I\u0027m not one of those who thinks Steve Vai is the embodiment \nof how to be a guitarist. I\u0027m more of a Joe Pass, Kiko Loureiro and Paco de \nLucia guy. It\u0027s imo a matter of balance between different styles. However, \nafter working for a while as a musician I do feel some of those guys \ndeserve a bit more of recognition. To me it\u0027s more difficult to keep \nimprovising while modulating, using inversions and keeping a clean sound \nthan only playing with distortion a pentatonic scale. Not saying that\u0027s bad \nsince I also believe simplicity in certain cases can bring out the best in \na musician but it does have its drawbacks.","+Zappandy despite? beause of that. All this \"dirt\" gives Hendrix\u0027 music the \nwarmth why I enjoy it.\nCleaner, more technical guitar players (shredders?) like Steve Vai who \nplayed for Zappa just don\u0027t appeal that much to me","+Alex Phillips In this context, I would call him a counterweight to the \nother two. He was well-known and popular, so it\u0027s cool to put him here. It \nisn\u0027t about his technique anyway, it\u0027s about how his instrument functioned.","That\u0027s mostly because he couldn\u0027t. He was a glorified punk guitarist.","+SurvivorAndBatman True. I mean it\u0027s also important to note that Hendrix\u0027s \nsound was too messy as well but Frank Zappa did say that with some decent \nmusic training he could had become an overall great musician. I still love \nhis sound despite that.\n\n\nAmong the ones mentioned, I prefer Page\u0027s cleaner sound but Hendrix\u0027s \nfeeling is just way too good and he did popularize the B.B. King sound.","+Alex Phillips He could write and had a unique voice and influenced several \nfamous musicians now but he was no guitar god","He is","+Paul Keefer His song from Dylan is over 50k years old.

Yay me!","+Spoder Man Exactly... Check out Stanley Jordan... Underrated, but amazing. \nAnd some of the best ever, like Joe Satriani, Jeff Beck, the ones you \nmentioned, etc. etc.","To be fair he wasn\u0027t that great of a guitarist. Definitely an amazing \nmusician and artists, but not a great guitarist. There are a million other \npeople he could\u0027ve mentioned like Steve Vai, Marty Friedman, Eddie Van \nHalen, Yngwie Malmsteem etc.","+Kris Wingfield Dimebag didn\u0027t define shredding, he just was one who could \ndo it. I\u0027m not going to argue that to be a shredder, someone has to be a \nheavy-metal guitarist--it certainly works with a skilled jazz or blues \nplayer, too--but it *does* involve fast playing of arpeggios and scales in \nsolos through techniques like sweep picking and tapping.\n\nAnd Cobain did *not* wail away. You can\u0027t name a single song where he was \nwailing at all. One of the biggest points behind Cobain\u0027s stance on music, \nNirvana\u0027s music, and the grunge and punk sounds, was that it was *very much* \nanti-wailing. Power-chords, clever and catchy riffs. No wailing.","That\u0027s what people came to think it means after hearing the likes of \nDimebag. But it goes back to before Dime was even born. And in those times \nit had nothing to do with how fast or technical a person could play. It was \nmore defined as just wailing away; which Kurt Cobain did admirably.","+Kris Wingfield No it doesn\u0027t. \"Shredding\" is a term reserved for fast, \nhighly technical solo playing typically associated with hard rock and heavy \nmetal.","+AgEyal \"Shredding\" has an extremely broad definition. It\u0027s not all \nDimebombs and sweeps. Give a listen to the Incesticide album for a clearer \nidea of what shredding means.","+M.W. Vaughn ikr like THAT IS NOT HOW YOU PRONOUNCE IT. Sorry about the all \ncaps but I\u0027m too lazy to retype it.","+Kris Wingfield Actually, Hendrix died from choking on his vomit. Not from \nan overdose. Yes, he did heroine, (which I would never condone) but he \nwasn\u0027t addicted to it. Kurt was, and went to rehab numerous times. He was \nnever the \"definition of shredding\". There were dozens of shredders before \nanyone knew he existed. Guys like Randy Rhodes and Eddie Van Halen were the \ndefinition of shredding. Hell, even Dimebag was shredding in the \u002780s. Kurt \nwas no more a shredder than Joe Strummer or Johnny Ramone or Neil Young. \nThe only difference is Kurt was a punk guitarist who wanted to be a \nshredder, but never could. And to compare him to a shredder is just \nridiculous. How\u0027s that for a history lesson?","+SirGarforth \"Whiny Junkie\"? Please tell me how Jimi Hendrix died.\n\nKurt Cobain was the definition of shredding until Dimebag came along and \npeople began associating his style with the term. You\u0027re in need of a \nhistory lesson.","+Endezeichen Grimm  It\u0027s just a subjective cultural term used by \nguitarists, you might even say Arto Lindsay can shred - it has no official \ndefinition, and it pretty much changes meaning every 5 years or so.","They can\u0027t fucking Shred. That is how so.","I love to pluck dem strings","+rrrwarrior44 Press 4","+rrrwarrior44 hahhhahhahhahhahhahhaahhaha","+Salamat Ali Not only that, the music was pretty bomb","+MohaCario yea, the music was over powering his voice...","+5jerry1 The video isn\u0027t about their specific techniques but our discussion \nis. And I love Jones\u0027s story, in that he picked up a guitar to be in a band \nand to look cool but the instrument ended up hooking him. It\u0027s the story of \na lot of musicians I\u0027ve seen over the years . . . myself included.","+braden7180 You mentioned punk guitarists and I immediately thought of \nSteve Jones. He is, I think, the most solid of the genre.(Just my two \ncents.)","+Steve C I think they just arbitrarily picked a few well-known names of \npeople connected with this instrument. The video isn\u0027t about any of their \ntechniques anyhow, it\u0027s about sound waves, so they could\u0027ve named just \nabout anybody and they\u0027d be relevant.","+Kris Wingfield  By your definition of a significant guitarist, Justin \nBieber is also a significant guitarist.  What you\u0027re basically saying is \nthat it doesn\u0027t matter how well you play the instrument, but how popular of \na guitarist you are. People keep defending Cobain whenever someone \ncriticizes him by saying \"that\u0027s just his style\". Like actual ability and \nmusical knowledge have no merit. There\u0027s nothing wrong with liking him, \njust don\u0027t try to compare him to people who can play better than him.","+Kris Wingfield No one\u0027s arguing that to be a good guitarist you have to be \na shredder. Paul Simon could play circles around tons of famous guitar \nplayers and I\u0027d never call him a shredder. On a technical level, East Bay \nRay is among the most skilled punk guitarists (definitely surpassing \nCobain), and he\u0027s no shredder. \"Shredding\" has a broad application but it \n*always* involves fast, technical playing.\n\nAnd I know the recent Corgan statement you\u0027re referencing and it was \nignorant. Not only on the \"no one plays guitar like him\" part--because \npretty much every decent punk rock band does--but also on the concept that \nno one is doing anything new with the instrument. There\u0027s tons of great \nplayers out there doing innovative things, it\u0027s just that they\u0027re not what \nthe big record companies or radio stations want right now, so if you aren\u0027t \nlooking for them you won\u0027t find them.","But he was. Even Billy Corgan said recently that no one plays guitar like \nhim anymore. He may not have been technical, he hardly ever even used full \nchords. But those things are not what make a good guitarist.","+Kris Wingfield He was a significant songwriter, a significant icon, and \nfronted a significant band. But he was not a significant guitarist.","+Kris Wingfield I conceded that it was an opinion. It\u0027s not that he wasn\u0027t \ninfluential, I just wouldn\u0027t have considered him top 3. Perhaps other \npeople might say the same thing about Hendrix and Page. Especially if you \nwant to talk about jazz or classical music. But it seemed like it centered \nmore on rock music.","+Steve C What\u0027s wrong with listing Cobain as a significant guitarist? His \nplaying style was vastly unique to anything people had heard in a long \ntime, nor anything since.\n\nSure the pop tunes we heard on the radio and MTV were simple six-chord \npieces with a solo that usually followed the verses\u0027 vocal melodies, but \nthat\u0027s exactly why Kurt Cobain hated his fame. He was misrepresented \nhardcore.\n\nGive the Incesticide album a listen and tell me Kurt Cobain was nothing \nmore than a three-chord wonder. Kurt Cobain was Angus Young with more heart.","+Cytokinetics s fair enough, it was a self-indulgent rant about the \nguitarist choices. However, pickups involve physics not just electronics. \nAnd then they go on to talk about the electronic signal can be manipulated. \nTalking about how the metal string vibrates in the magnetic field of the \npickup is an interesting bit of physics.","+Steve C way to pick the most inconsequential thing to complain about\nand it\u0027s a video about guitar physics not electronics","+seahawkers101 a Month , easily . depends on how many people are working on \nthis .","DAMN!","+TheMoleski To play blues guitar like BB King?

Maybe (no proof, just an idea), instead, it was to \npropitiate the god to end the earthquakes that plagued Crete.

The devil, or some other demon-like person tells Jesus to jump off \na wall to see if he\u0027ll float down unharmed, as it says would happen to \nbelievers in the old testament, but Jesus directly says God should never be \ntested.","+George Cataloni? The Bible in the old testament bit is quite clear about \nusing your head. Didn\u0027t god once asked Abraham to kill one of his sons? I \nthink it was one of those times when god choked in its own underestimation \nof the stupidity of its own creation. Abraham was going to follow through \nwithout question but it is obvious the intention was for Abraham to \nactually ask:\n\"Why... expletive... do you want me to do that?\"\nOr how about the bit in the new testament where Thomas would not believe \nJesus had done his ghost thing and would only believe if when he saw it?\n\nThe deal is not about unquestionable faith. I do not know myself since \nfaith eludes me. I am just arguing taking the side of the \"devil\".","+Adam Craig I didn\u0027t mean that God has to constantly update himself, I \nmeant our knowledge of him must update according to new information. But \nnot only does that not happen, religious people claim (rightly so, because \nit\u0027s in the Bible) that God isn\u0027t to be tested, but rather, we should \nbelieve without testing. That just makes religion impervious to criticism, \nthus unable to be checked for truth.","+Adam Craig I think you are misguided. Somewhere, perhaps even on the \ninternet, there is a tree of relationships between scientific fields. \nGranted, the tree has changed a bit over the centuries but dont keep such a \nclose mind over Theology. Science is made by people, it is not some entity \nwith its own mind updating itself. Since the creators and subsequent \ncontributors of the internet have a certain background, it is obvious that \ntheir side of things is more prominent than others. As is their use of \nEnglish.","+George Cataloni but theology is very different to science. They arnt meant \nto compete. Science updates itself as we test more and learn more. Theology \nisnt meant to be used this way otherwise it wouldnt be theology. For \nexample if a religion or God needed to constantly update it wouldnt be \ngenuine. \nThe problem is when people try to use religion to explain science. or use \nscience to explain religion. ","+Adam Craig It may not logically follow that one wrong religion makes the \nrest wrong, but at least science is updating itself, whereas religion is \nalways a shot in the dark, as far as anyone knows.","Criticising all religions because of the weirdest ones is like discounting \nall science because scientists once believed things that turned out to be \nbad science and wrong. ","+George Cataloni allow me to answer your question with the following \nstatement; there are people out there who believe they are vampires...","Its greek mythology.

This is \nthe internet, if people have some brain they could just google and find out \nfor themselves rather than wasting each other\u0027s time.","+J. Boyle No, your comment shows that you are ignorant of the facts and \nhave tried to change the subject. Good luck in your very sheltered life. bye","+Lorie Franceschi? wow, 2 semesters. That makes me a biologist and chemist \nalready, a historian/politician, and an expert in literature, along with a \npsychologist....\n\nAnyway, Christianity is not made up of different religions. If you can\u0027t \nfigure that one out, you wasted your money on classes. What myths were used \nto to help convert pagans. \n\nWhat does being in the Army have anything to do with christian history. I \nthought that comment was quite odd to add there.","+J. Boyle Actually, two semesters of Religious Studies at a CSU s were I \ngot my information. Talk to someone that has really study the early \nbeginnings of the Church and you will find I am correct. I have nothing \nagainst Christianity. The Apostles and later leaders of Christianity found \nit was easier to convert the masses when they took something that the \npeople believed and twisted it so that they would think it was from Jesus \nnot their Shaman. Remember which a lot of people forgot, the bible, both \nthe Old and the New were written by Humans, as a History of our Faith that \nthere is a God. \nDon\u0027t go running to a priest and ask them what I say is true, find an early \nChristianity scholar before you go saying what I have stated is incorrect. \n\nI served in The United States Army back during the Cold War \u002779-85) so that \nyou could believe what you want about God and the Christian belief system, \nbut please do some studying of your own and pick someone\u0027s brain that has \ndone about the early apostles and how the Church was really formed.","+Lorie Franceschi I wouldnt hold on to what you think you know. Your \nknowledge on Christianity is sub par and If I were you, I wouldnot go \naround spouting off your so called \"knowledge,\" as its making you look very \nuneducated.","+AdiSuba \n\nActually you can judge someones intelligence based on their faith (to a \ncertain extent), a meta analysis has shown that religious faith has a \nnegative correlation with intelligence:\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201311/religiosity-and-intelligence-century-research\n\nAnyway point being that degree of faith is one of many markers that can be \nused to judge someones intelligence. Religion is basically a behaviour, and \nlike any other behaviour can be used to judge a persons intellect.\n\nWe just don\u0027t like to talk about it because some particular demographics \nget upset about it.","+AdiSuba I don\u0027t like to judge people, but when some people say things like \nearth is 4000 years olds, vaccine causing autism, etc.despite all the \nfossil records, evolution isn\u0027t real despite we having new virus every \nyear,. It\u0027s hard not to judge them.","Agreed. I just meant to point out that you shouldn´t judge ones education \nand knowledge based on his faith.","+AdiSuba To be honest, yes. Whether it\u0027s teapot or Zeus, proving or \ndisproving wasn\u0027t the goal of science in the first place.","+Le Khoa Vu I´ll try to make this as short as possible. Science can neither \nprove nor disprove the existance of God.","+Lorie Franceschi For example, the Roman God Lucifer, the morning star, \nbecame another name for Satan.","+vertigo20001 I wouldn\u0027t say that science is trying to prove religion \nwrong. Science is just trying to find out how the world works. If that \ndisproves religion then so be it. But that\u0027s not the goal.","+????? ? Scientists are always trying to prove religion wrong and vice \nversa and the only one that\u0027s wrong is the one that claims to be right.","+????? ? I think it depends on the religion. Some, like Christianity and \nIslam, put God above the universe. Then others, like most polytheistic and \neastern religions, see Gods as part of nature/the universe. I think that\u0027s \nthe key difference. The former tries to explain away evidence to fit their \nworldview, whereas the latter incorporate the evidence into their beliefs. \nBut the people who say \"all religions are bad and should be done away with\" \ndon\u0027t quite grasp this concept. Yes, religions have done harm and can do \nharm, but they fail to realise all the good it does for people. \n\nThat\u0027s my two cents anyway.","+AdiSuba Truthfully, i don\u0027t know. Anything not involved with human i guess?\nI realized that i used the wrong word, natural cause, which only used when \nsomeone die. Which will make my comment sounds really weird to english \nspeakers, sorry about that.\n\n\nBut now that i think about it, the people back then didn\u0027t know what is \nnatural caused and what not. For example, lightning believed being made by \nZeus or Thor, or some water dragon; but then people can measure electricity \nand know that lightning is a electrostatic discharge of clouds.\n\n\nGoing back to the topic, \"Event A is natural cause, what is a natural \ncause?\". Answer: I don\u0027t know, the meaning is too big and vague. Which led \nme believe that i have been using the wrong word.\nThe correct word would be \u0027natural phenomena\u0027 and it fits the video nicely.\n(also, if you plan to ask me to define that word, drop the idea, google it, \ni believe you have the ability to do that, since you are on youtube)","+Le Khoa Vu And how would you define a natural cause?","+????? ? Christianity is made up of a bunch of different religions. the \nChristians would conquer some place and take what they thought they needed \nto convert the \"pagans\". example: the Egyptian god Ra was the Solar God and \nlater the god of creation. To get the tribes of Egypt to convert they took \nRa who was the god of the son and creation and used the word son in the \nEgyptian language to creaet what we use today,. there are many other myths \nthat were \"converted\" by the Early Christians to help convert the local \npagans in the areas that were being told the about the word of God. \n\nif I am wrong, it is not by too much.","+????? ? I have seen some parts of the internet and the youtube comment \nsections, lol. I don\u0027t think there is any cure for them. Look, we\u0027re on \nTed-ed so we can understand each other, but that won\u0027t be the case in some \nmore famous science video, you will see.\nOne thing i know though, youtube comment section is not the place for \nraising awareness, most of the time. The internet is now a big place, if \nanyone have some sort of doubting then they can find the answer for \nthemselves. We can\u0027t fight or force anything, it\u0027s people\u0027s choices, the \ngod of the gaps will do its job.","+Le Khoa Vu And that\u0027s like a very big problem, I mean, not accepting the \nscientific evidence. And I believe, it can only be fought with raising \neducational standards and lack of tolerance to intolerance, can it not?","+????? ? But you see, by saying that \"this event was due to natural caused \nand we can measure it by using evidence\" is not acceptable to some people \nwho think \"my god created everything\" or \"this is my god\u0027s doing, not \nnatural caused\".","+????? ? ehhh... I\u0027m a pagan and I understand that the Minotaur was most \nlikely not real.","+confiscator yea, matt is a bitch.","+Villads Sieling Well, that likely has something to do with the fact of how \nmythologies are retold by those left to tell them. The modern Minotaur is \nknown for being a bull-headed man who guards a labyrinth. Meanwhile the \noriginal tellings don\u0027t mention the Minotaur\u0027s form. It is people who came \nlater and said \"hmm. Man and Taurus (bull). Must look like a man-bull.\" \nThen comes the ever so iconic battle axe. Then, it becomes a generic term \nfor a type of creature that likes to roam mazes, rather than this specific \ncreature, and the origin is lost on modern culture.\n\nClearly the \"lore\" of the Minotaur isn\u0027t scientific, but its origins (as in \nthe actual way the story even started) is, if we are too assume what this \nguy says is true. \nMakes enough sense.","+Villads Sieling well now you know","+TheInterweb\u0027sMaster No it doesn\u0027t it. It\u0027s pure conjecture, and not even \nall that interesting conjecture, I mean, it certainly isn\u0027t very convincing.\n\n\nWhat it does it it draws a parallel between earthquakes and the earthquakes \nthe monster is supposed to have made. This, however, entirely misses what\u0027s \ninteresting and memorable about the minotaur: The idea of a monster pacing \nup and down the corridors of a labyrinth. \n\n\nThis is the core. Really, I didn\u0027t even know that the minotaur was supposed \nto have caused earthquakes.","+RiotFire88 This video isn\u0027t really about the lore of the Minotaur, it \nexplained how real life events, earthquakes, inspired the beast.","+tobster421 im so happy for you. what are you going to do now?","+tobster421 \ndude congratz!!!!"]},{"videoId":"de56W-F93nw","likes":2720,"dislikes":49,"over90":true,"over70":true,"over50":true,"over30":true,"views":85945,"comments":["What happened to the fifth brother??","As a Guatemalan born immigrant who served in the United States Marine \nCorps, I definitely understand the conflict of identity.

Never have I seen a dog stop barking when the owner \nyells at it, and i don\u0027t think you have either, thus i have the correct \naction, and your logic is nonsense","+successMANship It may be true for most dogs, not all dogs.\nAnd your tone of voice matters as well, not just whether you\u0027re yelling or \nnot. There are several types of yelling, some excited, some angry.\nI don\u0027t know about all dogs, but I know about my dog. I never yell because \nit isn\u0027t necessary, but previous family dog could get very excited seeing \nother dogs and yelling at it if it started to run off worked.\n\nAlso, with your logic, you being butthurt about people yelling at their \ndogs, it must mean their yelling is the correct action. But this logic is \nabsolutely nonsense.","So, why are you using inferior human technology?","+Mark The Gr8 wow if you are that butthurt i must be correct, and must\u0027ve \nstrucken a chord.

Your body changes, adapts to \nwhatever you are doing with it. So the more you physically do, the more \nefficient your body becomes. This presents a large problem for the media \nthat wants to sell you diet garbage. The media likes to tell you the exact \nopposite of how your body works, saying that larger people have slower \nmetabolism. This is flatly false. A basic physics equation W \u003d Fs (work \nequals force over distance). The more something weighs, the more force it \ntakes to move it over the same distance given a specific interval of time. \nWhat this means is that large people require more calories to do the same \namount of work as smaller people, and thus, they have to have a higher \nmetabolic rate. An athlete can utilize smaller amounts of calories to do \nthe same amount of work because their body has physiologically changed to \nbecome more efficient. That being said, chemically there is a *HUGE* monkey \nwrench in the works called hormonal state. The balance of hormones like \ntestosterone, estrogen,  cortisol and epinephrine can drastically change \nmetabolism. Estrogen is a real killer, it promotes fat storage, and fat \nstorage in turn.. produces more estrogen. Cortisol (caused by emotional and \nphysical stress) enables the dreaded belly fat storage. And here\u0027s the \nkicker, with enough testosterone, you can burn your fat stores, build \nmuscle and you don\u0027t require as much work and calories to do it. \nIn short, there\u0027s a whole lot to this that the diet industry tries to make \nyou ignore. They push diuretics (and call it cleanse) which stresses your \nkidneys, and any weight loss is water weight. They add stimulants too (and \nsay it gives you energy). Here\u0027s the kicker, they use caffeine as their \nactive ingredient. That doesn\u0027t work because:\n1. Your liver and kidneys \"cleanse\", and they don\u0027t need anything special \nto do it.\n2. Water weight is needed, your body is 55%-75% water and fluctuates \nfrequently.\n3.

I\u0027d \nlike to know where you got these \"facts\" because I suspect they\u0027re also \nunsubstantiated, but if there is evidence out there, either way I\u0027d like to \nknow about it.","+FractalZero\nOkay, I\u0027ll counter with \"I do know what I\u0027m talking about.\" lol","+HigherPlanes He seemed to be referring to the difference in caloric \ncontent in an item when it\u0027s utilized in the body versus combusted in a \nlab.It\u0027s actually factual that homonid brain capacity increased as our diet \nincreased in protein and fat. What you can debate is the CAUSAL link \nbetween the two, if they\u0027re connected or coincidental.\"Short gut\" is \nrelative to size. Digestion is essentially putrification, where bacteria \nand enzymes break down matter. Our GI tract breaks down the chemicals in \nfood to extract the nutrients and allow them to be transported into the \nbloodstream. Most animals that strictly eat very fibrous plants, like \nelephants, cattle, and gorillas have large, barrel-like torsos that \nessentially ferment plant matter.The appendix is a vestige of our \nevolutionary ancestry, and you can function just fine without it; I don\u0027t \nhave one.Cancer is a disease of statistics. If you live long enough, then \nyou\u0027ll develop some form of cancer. Prostate cancer in men has a direct \ncorrelation to age. For a 50 y.o. man he has a 50% chance of developing \nprostate cancer (ignoring other contributed factors, like genetics and \nsmoking), for a 75 y.o. it\u0027s 75%, and so forth. Also, better awareness and \ndiagnostics.However, this is all getting off the main point, which is the \nfact that the human diet isn\u0027t based on some kind of agency, and that the \nbody can thrive on a variety of diets. The important factor is getting all \nof the right nutrients and finding what works for you. A likely source of \nsuccess as a species is the fact that we can thrive on a highly varied \ndiet, so we were able to adapt to changes in food supplies.","+HigherPlanes You literally have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.","+sonicpsycho13\nWe know fiber is a transport system and insoluble. So when drago mentioned \nsomething like an additional 8,500 calories being released by the \napplication of heat, I assumed we were talking about nutrients available to \nthe body- that\u0027s the point of all this- what exits as waste is not \nimportant. But that\u0027s how it is on youtube, sometimes you competence \nsometimes you get clumsiness lol.\n\nBTW- it\u0027s only a hypothesis that our large brain correlates to consuming \nprotein/fats, it\u0027s not an established theory like say, for example, \"the \nEarth revolves around the sun\" That\u0027s a proven hypothesis. The \nbrain/protein theory is speculation and there are other theories to contend \nwith it. I\u0027m not trying to nitpick, but I think you also might be off \nhumans having short guts, our guts are relatively long compared to other \nmammals. Cats and canines do have a shorter gut becuase they do consume \nmeat, which becomes putrid and needs to exit the gut early. BTW- what do \nyou consider a short gut? I\u0027m 90% sure on this but you can look it up, but \nthe human gut length compared to other mammals is up there: I did a quick \nglance on this but it might be helpful:\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vestiges/appendix.html\n\nLast thing... to assume that the prevalence of cancer in modern society \nresults from an increased life expectancy is an assertion that humans are \nintrinsically designed and predisposed to illnesses like cancer. I\u0027m not \nconvinced that\u0027s the case. For the sake of accuracy, let\u0027s avoid \nspeculation and stick with the facts.","+HigherPlanes It\u0027s the fiber in plants that is indigestible, that is where \nthe unused calories come from. We can\u0027t digest cellulose, even though a \nmonomer of cellulose is identical to glucose. However, cellulose can be \ncombusted, hence firewood. Our bodies still use the fiber as transport in \nthe gut, though. Evidence that humans evolved as meat-eating omnivores is \nin our physiology. Early hominids developed large brains in conjunction \nwith a diet supplemented with protein and fat, mostly from eating fish. Our \nnarrow abdomens and short guts are typical of meat-eating animals. \nHerbivores tend to have larger guts to ferment plant matter or have gut \ncolonies that digest the plant matter. Cancer is also prevalent because we \nhave achieved great longevity from an abundance of food. When most people \nare living into their 80\u0027s and later, then genetic mutations eventually \ncatch up with them. Also, we have a better understanding of the diseases \nand diagnosis techniques. This is an example of Occam\u0027s razor. Your ability \nto get your nutrients from a variety of plant-based sources is due to \nglobalized food production. There\u0027s more than likely some nutrients that \nyou can\u0027t get yearround and need to import, like if you lived in a cool \nclimate, you\u0027d need to import citrus to get vitamin C.","+LordDragox412\nI don\u0027t know what happened in your past that led up to you being a complete \ndick, but you know, you can turn it around anytime.

The raw food diet has many \nsimilarities to paleo, such as automatically eliminating grains, starches, \nrefined sugars, and most fats. It also has the added effect of leaving many \nnutrients and calories locked up, whereas cooking would breakdown some more \ncomplex molecules to allow for more efficient absorption of nutrients and \ncalories. This is why raw food proponents can claim to eat 10,000 cal in a \nday, because if they burned all of that cellulose as a fire that\u0027s how much \nenergy would be released, but their GI tract may only be able to extract \nabout 1500 cal of the available 10,000, leaving the other 8500 to be \nliterally flushed away. Humans have actually evolved to eat meat and cook \nour foods. Meat is a very efficient source of calories and provides a lot \nof fat and protein for building tissues. Cooking kills microbes and makes \nfoods more digestible. There are also forms of processing that also change \nthe chemical make-up of foods, like drying almonds eliminates much of the \ncyanide that green almonds would contain. You can also cook foods \nchemically, rather than using heat, like ceviche, which uses citric acid to \ncook fish, or pickling. We can also use microbes to change the chemical \nstructure of foods, this is how we get cheese and yogurt. I\u0027m not saying \nthat what you\u0027re doing is wrong, and if it works for you and makes you \nhappy, then by all means continue. If you know what each food\u0027s limitations \nare, then you can get all of your calories, and micronutrients from raw \nplant sources, and maybe a little supplementation. I\u0027m trying to set the \nrecord straight that humans aren\u0027t predestined to survive in only one \nspecific way, but that there are many paths that can be taken to achieve \nthe same outcome.","+sonicpsycho13 I\u0027ve never tried the paleo diet and I don\u0027\u0027t know much about \nit other than what I\u0027ve read in an article or two, but I believe it allows \nthe consumption of cooked meat. I don\u0027t eat any cooked or processed food. I \ndo agree however that the landbase and soil is probably not what it once \nwas, but I take what I can get, try to stay organic (and I use that term \nlosely) whenever possible and I grow my own food as much possible. I\u0027m \nrelatively new at this, and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much data either way \nsupporting the long term health benefits of eating raw fruits and \nvegatables, but I have nothing to lose becuase the typical western diet \nisn\u0027t working and there IS plenty of evidence to support that.","+HigherPlanes Calorie counting can be a very effective approach for some \npeople, because it doesn\u0027t place artbitrary restrictions on diets, while \nencouraging home prep and production. This whole paleo fad is a bunch of \ncrap because the stuff that\u0027s available today is nowhere near what it was a \nfew thousand years ago. Paleo is really just another low carb diet, since \nit bars virtually all grains and starches.

We just \ncomplicate everything because we have this idea that we can improve on \nnature.","+HigherPlanes You\u0027re right that human are predisposed to be fat but the \nthing has evolved. I mean human tend to be fat easly, but why ? It\u0027s \nbecause the abundance of food isn\u0027t something given at our early history, \nwe had to hunt, to pick up fruits and veggies which depend our environment. \nSo in order to give high survivability to humanity, human orgasnim tend to \ngather excess calories into fat. That is the main reason that we tend to be \nfat easly like other mammal. BUT nowadays is a new another issue compare to \nour ancestor, our accessibility to food is really easy and not to mention \nthe food which are heavily in calories (which doesn\u0027t exist in natural \nenvironment). With few dollars (which is provided by work or by the \ngovernement when you\u0027re a lazy ass which doesn\u0027t help more) you have access \nto food without consuming any calories. Moreover the food that we have \naccess is really heavy in calories because our body is naturally attracted \nto this shit. Why ? Because, our organism tend to prefer high calories food \nin order to stock fat and have an higher chance to survive if there is a \npenury of food. \n\nIn this case, I disagree with you that counting calories is BS, because \nit\u0027s a tool that fit well in our present situation. People don\u0027t need to \nhave a calorie consumption in order to have food (contrary to our \nancestor), moreover people have access to heavy calorie food (which doesn\u0027t \nexist in natural states and is our weakness due to our bodies love to eat \nthose kind of food because of our disposition of \"survavibility\"). Since we \nevolved into this direction, means that we have to have some evolved tools \nto fit this generation. Otherwise you go back in time and do the same \nthings like our ancestor, then you don\u0027t have to worry about counting \ncalories. I\u0027m not saying that is necessary to count every calories because \nthere is people who have a healthy diet and life without counting, but if \nyou have hard time to control yourself being fat like a mofo, it can be \nsomething that help you to sort out which is good or not for your body.\n\nRegards","+HigherPlanes Actually no. It\u0027s the other way around. In some cases when \npeople try to eat \"healthy\" they unconsciously lower the calories they\u0027re \nconsuming because a lot of the food is less calorie dense so they lose \nweight because they consume less calories. \n\n\nBelieve it or not, I got fat eating \"healthy\" because I used to eat too \nmuch avocado and olives. My diet has always been overall healthy with more \nthan 80% of the food from natural sources. Not out of health obsession, but \nout of preference and habit. I lost nearly 100 pounds counting calories \nwhile eating ice cream, chocolate and cake occasionally like I always have \nbut reducing my daily calories and portions of the \"healthy\" foods I used \nto overeat on a daily basis to a reasonable amount. My actual diet has not \nchanged at all, only the portions did.\n\n\nThe reason anyone is fat is simple : they eat more than they burn. Why some \nnations are fat? Portions got bigger, food became cheaper and easily \navailable, cars made moving around easier, jobs got overall more \nsedentary.. etc, so calories eaten increased and calories burned decreased. \nWhy are people still fat?

It is inevitable that his ego, pride \nand sense of being more empowered would take over and lead him to his final \ndemise.","\u003d\u003d\u003d SPOILERS \u003d\u003d\u003d\n\n\n\n\n\n+ObserversEyes His story still fits all 3 criteria:\n\n1.) A guy who is, at least in the beginning, neither good nor bad. He is \nnot extraordinary in sense of role, ranking, or power, but he *is* \nextraordinary in terms of his chemical and scientific knowledge.\n2.) Although his cancer starts him out, his pride (Hamartia) and greed are \nthe true motivational catapults to both his heights as Heisernberg...\n3.) and later on to his fall. At this point Disaster and Downfall come in. \nAlthough he gains a lot, he doesn\u0027t keep very much of it, and ends up \nlosing things that matter a lot to him. Not only did Walt kill a lot of \npeople, both innocent and not-so innocent, in the end he loses himself, \nbecomes a monster, and still dies. Walt goes out in a blaze, while, \neveryone around him is left to deal with the ruins.\n\n\nI think #3, Downfall and Disaster, is where it becomes somewhat subjective. \nYou make the point that Walt dies on his own terms having become, for at \nleast a while, very powerful and wealthy, and so on. If nothing else, he \nmanages to leave behind a name and legend for himself and a small fortune \nfor his son.\n\n\nOn the other hand, he loses his soul, his family, causes the death of \nseveral innocents and those around him, loses his temporarily gained power, \nand still dies, high on his own product while he slowly bleeds out and the \ncops close in.","+Matt Sven\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dSPOILERS\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\n\n\nIn the beginning, he\u0027s working a second job in a car wash scrubbing the \ntires of one his students to make ends meet.  I don\u0027t think Walt has *everything \nhe wants* .  The cancer diagnoses is catharsis for change in which he \ndecides he needs to provide for his family before he dies.  Yes, things go \nawry and people get hurt including loved ones.  But in the end, he does \nprovide for his family before dying (by intimidating his old work partners \nto act as a conduit to funnel money to Walt Jr.)  And in a confession to \nSkylar, he states bluntly that he didn\u0027t in fact do it for the family \nentirely but for himself because he loved it and was \"quite good at it\".\n\nAnd yes, he dies at the end, but not from cancer, but on his own terms \ndoing what he loved doing.","\u003d\u003d\u003d SPOILERS \u003d\u003d\u003d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of the story, Walt has everything he could want, at minimum. \nThe love of his family, a sustainable, but not ideal income, and so on.\nAfter he is diagnosed with cancer, his pride and ambition lead him to do \nterrible things that endanger his family and all those around him.\nAlthough he ascends to positions of grandeur and conquers the meth \nindustry, in the end, he dies alone, bleeding out, and estranged from and \nhated by his family.","+ObserversEyes it starts by letting him fall, the he rises up with meth, \nsomething happens, and the cycle starts over.","+HarrymanGR look at ancient greek","Thanks, they should have said that in the vid.","+Rhea Joseph Breaking Bad is a tragedy."]},{"videoId":"th-zyfvwDdI","likes":5092,"dislikes":44,"over90":true,"over70":true,"over50":true,"over30":true,"views":168125,"comments":["Do not use semicolons; they show that you are a pretentious boob.?","There is a much more important use...\nwe programmers need it...\nhow do i mark the end of an instrucction else??",";-) OH MY!

They\u0027re hiding the future guys.","+Nathan Drake yup, if the site was known a century ago, we can be sure it \nwould have been looted clean by the imperialists","+monkey0in0a0cage I thought they had rivers of Mercury","+Random Gameplay Videos yh this is china we\u0027re talking about, the CCP says \nit wont open it. i\u0027\u0027m pretty sure imperial US,France and Britain opened the \nEgyptian tombs and not the Egyptians mantelshelves. China is a different \nstory bud","+Diana Baer make no,mistake, they are working on a plan for it. But it will \ntake at over a thousand trained professionals to minimize damage to the \nartifacts, the threat of,traps and,deaths. And the sheer magnitude of,this \nbeing the 1st emperors,tomb. \nBy comparison, even lesser pharohs. When their,tombs were found just \ncreated so much interest, funding, and national attention. It just takes \ntime, and China is just recently open to,outside cooperation, but could \neasily swing,back to,isolation. Time is needed","+monkey0in0a0cage They also don\u0027t want to open it because of the rivers of \nmercury.","+Random Gameplay Videos the terracotta soldiers were coloured when then \nfirst unearthed, but it soon faded after exposing to the air. they\u0027re not \ngonna dig any farther until they\u0027ve come up with a solution to preserve the \npaint.","+Random Gameplay Videos and also, just to make sure you understand that \nsealing the tomb has a serious reason, another copy-paste from \nancient-origins.net\nIt is unlikely that the tomb of Qin Shi Huang will be opened any time soon. \nFor a start, there are the tombs booby traps, as mentioned by Sima Qian. \nDespite being over two millennia old, it has been argued that they would \nstill function as effectively as the day they were installed. Furthermore, \nthe presence of mercury would be incredibly deadly to anyone who entered \nthe tomb without appropriate protection. Most importantly, however, is the \nfact that our technology at present would not be adequate to deal with the \nsheer scale of the underground complex and the preservation of the \nexcavated artifacts. As a case in point, the terracotta warriors were once \nbrightly painted, though exposure to the air and sunlight caused the paint \nto flake off almost immediately. Until further technological advancements \nhave been made, it is unlikely that archaeologists will risk opening the \ntomb of the first emperor of China.","+Random Gameplay Videos Here i copied this from wikipedia The tomb remains \nunopened, given concerns about preserving its artifacts.[22] For example, \nafter their excavation, the painted surface present on some terracotta \nfigures began to flake and fade.[24] The lacquer covering the paint can \ncurl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi\u0027an\u0027s dry air and can flake off \nin just four minutes.","+Random Gameplay Videos They didn\u0027t dare to open it. The emperor\u0027s tomb has \nbeen air-locked for soo long, if they open it, air will rush into the \nchamber, and the decaying process will be so quick that it will all be \ndamaged massively.","+Rambutan Law - I\u0027m pretty sure they did open it at some point, but they \ndid it in silence. Maybe something went wrong and what best way to cover \nthat by saying they didn\u0027t go there in the first place. We didn\u0027t give that \nmany shits for other important artifacts / tombs, be that egyptian, mayan \nor you name it. We took them out and made a shit-load of tests on them. How \nis this more important ? It\u0027s not... they did open it. It\u0027s for you to \nbelive what they say or not.","They opened the outer layers, where the servant stayed. The inner tomb, \nwhere the emperor lie, remain untouched.","They haven\u0027t opened it.
